462	PREFACE

463	

464	

465	Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two

466	were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates

467	of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an

468	individual—he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom

469	I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.

470	

471	The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and

472	slaves in the West at the period of this story—that is to say, thirty or

473	forty years ago.

474	

475	Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and

476	girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,

477	for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what

478	they once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,

479	and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.

480	

481	THE AUTHOR.

487	

488	CHAPTER I

489	

490	

491	“TOM!”

492	

493	No answer.

494	

495	“TOM!”

496	

497	No answer.

498	

499	“What’s gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!”

500	

501	No answer.

502	

503	The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the

504	room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or

505	never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were

506	her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not

507	service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.

508	She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but

509	still loud enough for the furniture to hear:

510	

511	“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I’ll—”

512	

513	She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching

514	under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the

515	punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.

516	

517	“I never did see the beat of that boy!”

518	

519	She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the

520	tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So

521	she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:

522	

523	“Y-o-u-u TOM!”

524	

525	There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize

526	a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.

527	

528	“There! I might ’a’ thought of that closet. What you been doing in

529	there?”

530	

531	“Nothing.”

532	

533	“Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that

534	truck?”

535	

536	“I don’t know, aunt.”

537	

538	“Well, I know. It’s jam—that’s what it is. Forty times I’ve said if you

539	didn’t let that jam alone I’d skin you. Hand me that switch.”

540	

541	The switch hovered in the air—the peril was desperate—

542	

543	“My! Look behind you, aunt!”

544	

545	The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.

546	The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and

547	disappeared over it.

548	

549	His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle

550	laugh.

551	

552	“Hang the boy, can’t I never learn anything? Ain’t he played me tricks

553	enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old

554	fools is the biggest fools there is. Can’t learn an old dog new tricks,

555	as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,

556	and how is a body to know what’s coming? He ’pears to know just how long

557	he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make

558	out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it’s all down again and

559	I can’t hit him a lick. I ain’t doing my duty by that boy, and that’s

560	the Lord’s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child,

561	as the Good Book says. I’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both,

562	I know. He’s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he’s my own

563	dead sister’s boy, poor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash him,

564	somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and

565	every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is

566	born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture

567	says, and I reckon it’s so. He’ll play hookey this evening, * and [*

568	Southwestern for “afternoon”] I’ll just be obleeged to make him work,

569	tomorrow, to punish him. It’s mighty hard to make him work Saturdays,

570	when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he

571	hates anything else, and I’ve _got_ to do some of my duty by him, or

572	I’ll be the ruination of the child.”

573	

574	Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home

575	barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s wood

576	and split the kindlings before supper—at least he was there in time

577	to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.

578	Tom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through

579	with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,

580	and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.

581	

582	While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity

583	offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and

584	very deep—for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like

585	many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she

586	was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she

587	loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low

588	cunning. Said she:

589	

590	“Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t it?”

591	

592	“Yes’m.”

593	

594	“Powerful warm, warn’t it?”

595	

596	“Yes’m.”

597	

598	“Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?”

599	

600	A bit of a scare shot through Tom—a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He

601	searched Aunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:

602	

603	“No’m—well, not very much.”

604	

605	The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s shirt, and said:

606	

607	“But you ain’t too warm now, though.” And it flattered her to reflect

608	that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing

609	that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew

610	where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:

611	

612	“Some of us pumped on our heads—mine’s damp yet. See?”

613	

614	Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of

615	circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new

616	inspiration:

617	

618	“Tom, you didn’t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to

619	pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!”

620	

621	The trouble vanished out of Tom’s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt

622	collar was securely sewed.

623	

624	“Bother! Well, go ’long with you. I’d made sure you’d played hookey

625	and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you’re a kind of a

626	singed cat, as the saying is—better’n you look. _This_ time.”

627	

628	She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom

629	had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.

630	

631	But Sidney said:

632	

633	“Well, now, if I didn’t think you sewed his collar with white thread,

634	but it’s black.”

635	

636	“Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!”

637	

638	But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:

639	

640	“Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.”

641	

642	In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into

643	the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them—one needle

644	carried white thread and the other black. He said:

645	

646	“She’d never noticed if it hadn’t been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes

647	she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to

648	gee-miny she’d stick to one or t’other—I can’t keep the run of ’em. But

649	I bet you I’ll lam Sid for that. I’ll learn him!”

650	

651	He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well

652	though—and loathed him.

653	

654	Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not

655	because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a

656	man’s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore

657	them down and drove them out of his mind for the time—just as men’s

658	misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new

659	interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired

660	from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It

661	consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,

662	produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short

663	intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to

664	do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him

665	the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of

666	harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer

667	feels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt, as far as strong, deep,

668	unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the

669	astronomer.

670	

671	The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom

672	checked his whistle. A stranger was before him—a boy a shade larger

673	than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive

674	curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy

675	was well dressed, too—well dressed on a week-day. This was simply

676	astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth

677	roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes

678	on—and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of

679	ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom’s vitals. The

680	more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose

681	at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to

682	him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved—but only

683	sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the

684	time. Finally Tom said:

685	

686	“I can lick you!”

687	

688	“I’d like to see you try it.”

689	

690	“Well, I can do it.”

691	

692	“No you can’t, either.”

693	

694	“Yes I can.”

695	

696	“No you can’t.”

697	

698	“I can.”

699	

700	“You can’t.”

701	

702	“Can!”

703	

704	“Can’t!”

705	

706	An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:

707	

708	“What’s your name?”

709	

710	“’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.”

711	

712	“Well I ’low I’ll _make_ it my business.”

713	

714	“Well why don’t you?”

715	

716	“If you say much, I will.”

717	

718	“Much—much—_much_. There now.”

719	

720	“Oh, you think you’re mighty smart, _don’t_ you? I could lick you with

721	one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.”

722	

723	“Well why don’t you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.”

724	

725	“Well I _will_, if you fool with me.”

726	

727	“Oh yes—I’ve seen whole families in the same fix.”

728	

729	“Smarty! You think you’re _some_, now, _don’t_ you? Oh, what a hat!”

730	

731	“You can lump that hat if you don’t like it. I dare you to knock it

732	off—and anybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.”

733	

734	“You’re a liar!”

735	

736	“You’re another.”

737	

738	“You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t take it up.”

739	

740	“Aw—take a walk!”

741	

742	“Say—if you give me much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce a rock

743	off’n your head.”

744	

745	“Oh, of _course_ you will.”

746	

747	“Well I _will_.”

748	

749	“Well why don’t you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will

750	for? Why don’t you _do_ it? It’s because you’re afraid.”

751	

752	“I _ain’t_ afraid.”

753	

754	“You are.”

755	

756	“I ain’t.”

757	

758	“You are.”

759	

760	Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently

761	they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:

762	

763	“Get away from here!”

764	

765	“Go away yourself!”

766	

767	“I won’t.”

768	

769	“I won’t either.”

770	

771	So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both

772	shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But

773	neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and

774	flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:

775	

776	“You’re a coward and a pup. I’ll tell my big brother on you, and he can

777	thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll make him do it, too.”

778	

779	“What do I care for your big brother? I’ve got a brother that’s bigger

780	than he is—and what’s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.”

781	 [Both brothers were imaginary.]

782	

783	“That’s a lie.”

784	

785	“_Your_ saying so don’t make it so.”

786	

787	Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:

788	

789	“I dare you to step over that, and I’ll lick you till you can’t stand

790	up. Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal sheep.”

791	

792	The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:

793	

794	“Now you said you’d do it, now let’s see you do it.”

795	

796	“Don’t you crowd me now; you better look out.”

797	

798	“Well, you _said_ you’d do it—why don’t you do it?”

799	

800	“By jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.”

801	

802	The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out

803	with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys

804	were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and

805	for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other’s hair and

806	clothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose, and covered themselves

807	with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the

808	fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him

809	with his fists. “Holler ’nuff!” said he.

810	

811	The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying—mainly from rage.

812	

813	“Holler ’nuff!”—and the pounding went on.

814	

815	At last the stranger got out a smothered “’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and

816	said:

817	

818	“Now that’ll learn you. Better look out who you’re fooling with next

819	time.”

820	

821	The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,

822	snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and

823	threatening what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught him out.”

824	 To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and

825	as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it

826	and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like

827	an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he

828	lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the

829	enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the

830	window and declined. At last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called Tom

831	a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but

832	he said he “’lowed” to “lay” for that boy.

833	

834	He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in

835	at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and

836	when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his

837	Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its

838	firmness.

839	

840	

841	

842	

843	CHAPTER II

844	

845	

846	SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and

847	fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if

848	the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in

849	every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom

850	and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond

851	the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far

852	enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.

853	

854	Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a

855	long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and

856	a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board

857	fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a

858	burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost

859	plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant

860	whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed

861	fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at

862	the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from

863	the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before, but

864	now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at

865	the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there

866	waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,

867	skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred

868	and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an

869	hour—and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:

870	

871	“Say, Jim, I’ll fetch the water if you’ll whitewash some.”

872	

873	Jim shook his head and said:

874	

875	“Can’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an’ git dis water

876	an’ not stop foolin’ roun’ wid anybody. She say she spec’ Mars Tom gwine

877	to ax me to whitewash, an’ so she tole me go ’long an’ ’tend to my own

878	business—she ’lowed _she’d_ ’tend to de whitewashin’.”

879	

880	“Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That’s the way she always talks.

881	Gimme the bucket—I won’t be gone only a a minute. _She_ won’t ever

882	know.”

883	

884	“Oh, I dasn’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis she’d take an’ tar de head off’n me.

885	’Deed she would.”

886	

887	“_She_! She never licks anybody—whacks ’em over the head with her

888	thimble—and who cares for that, I’d like to know. She talks awful, but

889	talk don’t hurt—anyways it don’t if she don’t cry. Jim, I’ll give you a

890	marvel. I’ll give you a white alley!”

891	

892	Jim began to waver.

893	

894	“White alley, Jim! And it’s a bully taw.”

895	

896	“My! Dat’s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I’s powerful

897	’fraid ole missis—”

898	

899	“And besides, if you will I’ll show you my sore toe.”

900	

901	Jim was only human—this attraction was too much for him. He put down

902	his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing

903	interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he

904	was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was

905	whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with

906	a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.

907	

908	But Tom’s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had

909	planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys

910	would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and

911	they would make a world of fun of him for having to work—the very

912	thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and

913	examined it—bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange

914	of _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour

915	of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and

916	gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless

917	moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,

918	magnificent inspiration.

919	

920	He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in

921	sight presently—the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been

922	dreading. Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough that his

923	heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and

924	giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned

925	ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As

926	he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned

927	far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp

928	and circumstance—for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered

929	himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and

930	engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own

931	hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:

932	

933	“Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!” The headway ran almost out, and he

934	drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.

935	

936	“Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!” His arms straightened and stiffened

937	down his sides.

938	

939	“Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!

940	Chow!” His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles—for it was

941	representing a forty-foot wheel.

942	

943	“Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!”

944	 The left hand began to describe circles.

945	

946	“Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on

947	the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling!

948	Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _lively_ now! Come—out with

949	your spring-line—what’re you about there! Take a turn round that stump

950	with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now—let her go! Done with

951	the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH’T! S’H’T! SH’T!” (trying the

952	gauge-cocks).

953	

954	Tom went on whitewashing—paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared

955	a moment and then said: “_Hi-Yi! You’re_ up a stump, ain’t you!”

956	

957	No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then

958	he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as

959	before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the

960	apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:

961	

962	“Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?”

963	

964	Tom wheeled suddenly and said:

965	

966	“Why, it’s you, Ben! I warn’t noticing.”

967	

968	“Say—I’m going in a-swimming, I am. Don’t you wish you could? But of

969	course you’d druther _work_—wouldn’t you? Course you would!”

970	

971	Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:

972	

973	“What do you call work?”

974	

975	“Why, ain’t _that_ work?”

976	

977	Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:

978	

979	“Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain’t. All I know, is, it suits Tom

980	Sawyer.”

981	

982	“Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you _like_ it?”

983	

984	The brush continued to move.

985	

986	“Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a

987	chance to whitewash a fence every day?”

988	

989	That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.

990	Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth—stepped back to note the

991	effect—added a touch here and there—criticised the effect again—Ben

992	watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more

993	absorbed. Presently he said:

994	

995	“Say, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.”

996	

997	Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:

998	

999	“No—no—I reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful

1000	particular about this fence—right here on the street, you know—but if it

1001	was the back fence I wouldn’t mind and _she_ wouldn’t. Yes, she’s awful

1002	particular about this fence; it’s got to be done very careful; I reckon

1003	there ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it

1004	the way it’s got to be done.”

1005	

1006	“No—is that so? Oh come, now—lemme just try. Only just a little—I’d let

1007	_you_, if you was me, Tom.”

1008	

1009	“Ben, I’d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly—well, Jim wanted to do

1010	it, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn’t let

1011	Sid. Now don’t you see how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence

1012	and anything was to happen to it—”

1013	

1014	“Oh, shucks, I’ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say—I’ll give you

1015	the core of my apple.”

1016	

1017	“Well, here—No, Ben, now don’t. I’m afeard—”

1018	

1019	“I’ll give you _all_ of it!”

1020	

1021	Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his

1022	heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the

1023	sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,

1024	dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more

1025	innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every

1026	little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time

1027	Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for

1028	a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in

1029	for a dead rat and a string to swing it with—and so on, and so on, hour

1030	after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a

1031	poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in

1032	wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part

1033	of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool

1034	cannon, a key that wouldn’t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a

1035	glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,

1036	six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a

1037	dog-collar—but no dog—the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,

1038	and a dilapidated old window sash.

1039	

1040	He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while—plenty of company—and

1041	the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn’t run out of

1042	whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.

1043	

1044	Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He

1045	had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it—namely,

1046	that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary

1047	to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and

1048	wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have

1049	comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do,

1050	and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And

1051	this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or

1052	performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing

1053	Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England

1054	who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a

1055	daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable

1056	money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn

1057	it into work and then they would resign.

1058	

1059	The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place

1060	in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to

1061	report.

1062	

1063	

1064	

1065	

1066	CHAPTER III

1067	

1068	

1069	TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an

1070	open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,

1071	breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer

1072	air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing

1073	murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her

1074	knitting—for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her

1075	lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had

1076	thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at

1077	seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He

1078	said: “Mayn’t I go and play now, aunt?”

1079	

1080	“What, a’ready? How much have you done?”

1081	

1082	“It’s all done, aunt.”

1083	

1084	“Tom, don’t lie to me—I can’t bear it.”

1085	

1086	“I ain’t, aunt; it _is_ all done.”

1087	

1088	Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for

1089	herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of

1090	Tom’s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and

1091	not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a

1092	streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She

1093	said:

1094	

1095	“Well, I never! There’s no getting round it, you can work when you’re a

1096	mind to, Tom.” And then she diluted the compliment by adding, “But it’s

1097	powerful seldom you’re a mind to, I’m bound to say. Well, go ’long and

1098	play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I’ll tan you.”

1099	

1100	She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took

1101	him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,

1102	along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat

1103	took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.

1104	And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he “hooked” a

1105	doughnut.

1106	

1107	Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway

1108	that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and

1109	the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a

1110	hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties

1111	and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,

1112	and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general

1113	thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at

1114	peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his

1115	black thread and getting him into trouble.

1116	

1117	Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the

1118	back of his aunt’s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach

1119	of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the

1120	village, where two “military” companies of boys had met for conflict,

1121	according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these

1122	armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two

1123	great commanders did not condescend to fight in person—that being better

1124	suited to the still smaller fry—but sat together on an eminence

1125	and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through

1126	aides-de-camp. Tom’s army won a great victory, after a long and

1127	hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,

1128	the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the

1129	necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and

1130	marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.

1131	

1132	As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new

1133	girl in the garden—a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow

1134	hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered

1135	pan-talettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A

1136	certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a

1137	memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;

1138	he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor

1139	little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had

1140	confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest

1141	boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time

1142	she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is

1143	done.

1144	

1145	He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had

1146	discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and

1147	began to “show off” in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win

1148	her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;

1149	but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic

1150	performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending

1151	her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,

1152	grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a

1153	moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great

1154	sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up,

1155	right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she

1156	disappeared.

1157	

1158	The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and

1159	then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as

1160	if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.

1161	Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his

1162	nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,

1163	in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his

1164	bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped

1165	away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a

1166	minute—only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next

1167	his heart—or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in

1168	anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.

1169	

1170	He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, “showing

1171	off,” as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom

1172	comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some

1173	window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode

1174	home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.

1175	

1176	All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered “what

1177	had got into the child.” He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and

1178	did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his

1179	aunt’s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:

1180	

1181	“Aunt, you don’t whack Sid when he takes it.”

1182	

1183	“Well, Sid don’t torment a body the way you do. You’d be always into

1184	that sugar if I warn’t watching you.”

1185	

1186	Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,

1187	reached for the sugar-bowl—a sort of glorying over Tom which was

1188	wellnigh unbearable. But Sid’s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and

1189	broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled

1190	his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a

1191	word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she

1192	asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be

1193	nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model “catch it.” He was

1194	so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old

1195	lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath

1196	from over her spectacles. He said to himself, “Now it’s coming!” And the

1197	next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted

1198	to strike again when Tom cried out:

1199	

1200	“Hold on, now, what ’er you belting _me_ for?—Sid broke it!”

1201	

1202	Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when

1203	she got her tongue again, she only said:

1204	

1205	“Umf! Well, you didn’t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some

1206	other audacious mischief when I wasn’t around, like enough.”

1207	

1208	Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something

1209	kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a

1210	confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.

1211	So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.

1212	Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart

1213	his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the

1214	consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice

1215	of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,

1216	through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured

1217	himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching

1218	one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and

1219	die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured

1220	himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and

1221	his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how

1222	her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back

1223	her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would

1224	lie there cold and white and make no sign—a poor little sufferer, whose

1225	griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of

1226	these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke;

1227	and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked,

1228	and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to

1229	him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any

1230	worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too

1231	sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced

1232	in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit

1233	of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness

1234	out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.

1235	

1236	He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate

1237	places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river

1238	invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated

1239	the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could

1240	only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the

1241	uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower.

1242	He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal

1243	felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she

1244	cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and

1245	comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?

1246	This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he

1247	worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and

1248	varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing

1249	and departed in the darkness.

1250	

1251	About half-past nine or ten o’clock he came along the deserted street to

1252	where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon

1253	his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain

1254	of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the

1255	fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under

1256	that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him

1257	down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his

1258	hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.

1259	And thus he would die—out in the cold world, with no shelter over his

1260	homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,

1261	no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And

1262	thus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and

1263	oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would

1264	she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,

1265	so untimely cut down?

1266	

1267	The window went up, a maid-servant’s discordant voice profaned the holy

1268	calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr’s remains!

1269	

1270	The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz

1271	as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound

1272	as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the

1273	fence and shot away in the gloom.

1274	

1275	Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his

1276	drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he

1277	had any dim idea of making any “references to allusions,” he thought

1278	better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom’s eye.

1279	

1280	Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental

1281	note of the omission.

1282	

1283	

1284	

1285	

1286	CHAPTER IV

1287	

1288	

1289	THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful

1290	village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family

1291	worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid

1292	courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of

1293	originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of

1294	the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.

1295	

1296	Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to “get

1297	his verses.” Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his

1298	energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the

1299	Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.

1300	At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,

1301	but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human

1302	thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took

1303	his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the

1304	fog:

1305	

1306	“Blessed are the—a—a—”

1307	

1308	“Poor”—

1309	

1310	“Yes—poor; blessed are the poor—a—a—”

1311	

1312	“In spirit—”

1313	

1314	“In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they—they—”

1315	

1316	“_Theirs_—”

1317	

1318	“For _theirs_. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom

1319	of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they—they—”

1320	

1321	“Sh—”

1322	

1323	“For they—a—”

1324	

1325	“S, H, A—”

1326	

1327	“For they S, H—Oh, I don’t know what it is!”

1328	

1329	“_Shall_!”

1330	

1331	“Oh, _shall_! for they shall—for they shall—a—a—shall

1332	mourn—a—a—blessed are they that shall—they that—a—they that

1333	shall mourn, for they shall—a—shall _what_? Why don’t you tell me,

1334	Mary?—what do you want to be so mean for?”

1335	

1336	“Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I wouldn’t

1337	do that. You must go and learn it again. Don’t you be discouraged, Tom,

1338	you’ll manage it—and if you do, I’ll give you something ever so nice.

1339	There, now, that’s a good boy.”

1340	

1341	“All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.”

1342	

1343	“Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it’s nice, it is nice.”

1344	

1345	“You bet you that’s so, Mary. All right, I’ll tackle it again.”

1346	

1347	And he did “tackle it again”—and under the double pressure of curiosity

1348	and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a

1349	shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow” knife worth twelve

1350	and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system

1351	shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,

1352	but it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur

1353	in that—though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a

1354	weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing

1355	mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the

1356	cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was

1357	called off to dress for Sunday-school.

1358	

1359	Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went

1360	outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he

1361	dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;

1362	poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen

1363	and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But

1364	Mary removed the towel and said:

1365	

1366	“Now ain’t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn’t be so bad. Water won’t hurt

1367	you.”

1368	

1369	Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he

1370	stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath

1371	and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut

1372	and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of

1373	suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from

1374	the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped

1375	short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line

1376	there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in

1377	front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she

1378	was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of

1379	color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls

1380	wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately

1381	smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his

1382	hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his

1383	own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his

1384	clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years—they were

1385	simply called his “other clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his

1386	wardrobe. The girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself;

1387	she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt

1388	collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with

1389	his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and

1390	uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there

1391	was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He

1392	hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she

1393	coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought

1394	them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do

1395	everything he didn’t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:

1396	

1397	“Please, Tom—that’s a good boy.”

1398	

1399	So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three

1400	children set out for Sunday-school—a place that Tom hated with his whole

1401	heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.

1402	

1403	Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church

1404	service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,

1405	and the other always remained too—for stronger reasons. The church’s

1406	high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;

1407	the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board

1408	tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step

1409	and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:

1410	

1411	“Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?”

1412	

1413	“Yes.”

1414	

1415	“What’ll you take for her?”

1416	

1417	“What’ll you give?”

1418	

1419	“Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.”

1420	

1421	“Less see ’em.”

1422	

1423	Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.

1424	Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some

1425	small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other

1426	boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten

1427	or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm

1428	of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started

1429	a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,

1430	elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a

1431	boy’s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy

1432	turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear

1433	him say “Ouch!” and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom’s whole

1434	class were of a pattern—restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came

1435	to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but

1436	had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each

1437	got his reward—in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture

1438	on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten

1439	blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red

1440	tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent

1441	gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy

1442	times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and

1443	application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And

1444	yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way—it was the patient work of

1445	two years—and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once

1446	recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his

1447	mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot

1448	from that day forth—a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great

1449	occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it)

1450	had always made this boy come out and “spread himself.” Only the older

1451	pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work

1452	long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes

1453	was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so

1454	great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s

1455	heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple

1456	of weeks. It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really

1457	hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being

1458	had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.

1459	

1460	In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with

1461	a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its

1462	leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent

1463	makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as

1464	necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer

1465	who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert—though

1466	why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music

1467	is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim

1468	creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he

1469	wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears

1470	and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth—a

1471	fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the

1472	whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a

1473	spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had

1474	fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion

1475	of the day, like sleigh-runners—an effect patiently and laboriously

1476	produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a

1477	wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very

1478	sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places

1479	in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that

1480	unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar

1481	intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this

1482	fashion:

1483	

1484	“Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as

1485	you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There—that

1486	is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one

1487	little girl who is looking out of the window—I am afraid she thinks I

1488	am out there somewhere—perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech

1489	to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it

1490	makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a

1491	place like this, learning to do right and be good.” And so forth and so

1492	on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a

1493	pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.

1494	

1495	The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights

1496	and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings

1497	and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of

1498	isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound

1499	ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and the

1500	conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.

1501	

1502	A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was

1503	more or less rare—the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied

1504	by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman

1505	with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s

1506	wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of

1507	chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too—he could not meet Amy

1508	Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this

1509	small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next

1510	moment he was “showing off” with all his might—cuffing boys, pulling

1511	hair, making faces—in a word, using every art that seemed likely to

1512	fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one

1513	alloy—the memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden—and that

1514	record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that

1515	were sweeping over it now.

1516	

1517	The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.

1518	Walters’ speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The

1519	middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage—no less a one

1520	than the county judge—altogether the most august creation these children

1521	had ever looked upon—and they wondered what kind of material he was made

1522	of—and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,

1523	too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away—so he had travelled,

1524	and seen the world—these very eyes had looked upon the county

1525	court-house—which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these

1526	reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the

1527	ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of

1528	their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar

1529	with the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music

1530	to his soul to hear the whisperings:

1531	

1532	“Look at him, Jim! He’s a going up there. Say—look! he’s a going to

1533	shake hands with him—he _is_ shaking hands with him! By jings, don’t you

1534	wish you was Jeff?”

1535	

1536	Mr. Walters fell to “showing off,” with all sorts of official bustlings

1537	and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging

1538	directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The

1539	librarian “showed off”—running hither and thither with his arms full of

1540	books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority

1541	delights in. The young lady teachers “showed off”—bending sweetly over

1542	pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers

1543	at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen

1544	teachers “showed off” with small scoldings and other little displays of

1545	authority and fine attention to discipline—and most of the teachers, of

1546	both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was

1547	business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times

1548	(with much seeming vexation). The little girls “showed off” in various

1549	ways, and the little boys “showed off” with such diligence that the air

1550	was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it

1551	all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all

1552	the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur—for he was

1553	“showing off,” too.

1554	

1555	There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete,

1556	and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.

1557	Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough—he had been

1558	around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now,

1559	to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.

1560	

1561	And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with

1562	nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded

1563	a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not

1564	expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But

1565	there was no getting around it—here were the certified checks, and they

1566	were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with

1567	the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from

1568	headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and

1569	so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the

1570	judicial one’s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon

1571	in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy—but those that

1572	suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they

1573	themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to

1574	Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.

1575	These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a

1576	guileful snake in the grass.

1577	

1578	The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the

1579	superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked

1580	somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct taught him

1581	that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,

1582	perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two

1583	thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises—a dozen would

1584	strain his capacity, without a doubt.

1585	

1586	Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in

1587	her face—but he wouldn’t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain

1588	troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went—came again; she watched;

1589	a furtive glance told her worlds—and then her heart broke, and she was

1590	jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most

1591	of all (she thought).

1592	

1593	Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath

1594	would hardly come, his heart quaked—partly because of the awful

1595	greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would

1596	have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The

1597	Judge put his hand on Tom’s head and called him a fine little man, and

1598	asked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:

1599	

1600	“Tom.”

1601	

1602	“Oh, no, not Tom—it is—”

1603	

1604	“Thomas.”

1605	

1606	“Ah, that’s it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That’s very well.

1607	But you’ve another one I daresay, and you’ll tell it to me, won’t you?”

1608	

1609	“Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,” said Walters, “and say

1610	sir. You mustn’t forget your manners.”

1611	

1612	“Thomas Sawyer—sir.”

1613	

1614	“That’s it! That’s a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two

1615	thousand verses is a great many—very, very great many. And you never can

1616	be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth

1617	more than anything there is in the world; it’s what makes great men

1618	and good men; you’ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some

1619	day, Thomas, and then you’ll look back and say, It’s all owing to the

1620	precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood—it’s all owing to

1621	my dear teachers that taught me to learn—it’s all owing to the good

1622	superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a

1623	beautiful Bible—a splendid elegant Bible—to keep and have it all for my

1624	own, always—it’s all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will

1625	say, Thomas—and you wouldn’t take any money for those two thousand

1626	verses—no indeed you wouldn’t. And now you wouldn’t mind telling me and

1627	this lady some of the things you’ve learned—no, I know you wouldn’t—for

1628	we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names

1629	of all the twelve disciples. Won’t you tell us the names of the first

1630	two that were appointed?”

1631	

1632	Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,

1633	now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. He said

1634	to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest

1635	question—why _did_ the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up

1636	and say:

1637	

1638	“Answer the gentleman, Thomas—don’t be afraid.”

1639	

1640	Tom still hung fire.

1641	

1642	“Now I know you’ll tell me,” said the lady. “The names of the first two

1643	disciples were—”

1644	

1645	“_David And Goliah!_”

1646	

1647	Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.

1648	

1649	

1650	

1651	

1652	CHAPTER V

1653	

1654	

1655	ABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,

1656	and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The

1657	Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and

1658	occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt

1659	Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her—Tom being placed next

1660	the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window

1661	and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up

1662	the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;

1663	the mayor and his wife—for they had a mayor there, among other

1664	unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglas, fair,

1665	smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill

1666	mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much

1667	the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could

1668	boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the

1669	new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by

1670	a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all

1671	the young clerks in town in a body—for they had stood in the vestibule

1672	sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering

1673	admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came

1674	the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as

1675	if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was

1676	the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so

1677	good. And besides, he had been “thrown up to them” so much. His

1678	white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on

1679	Sundays—accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys

1680	who had as snobs.

1681	

1682	The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,

1683	to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the

1684	church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the

1685	choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all

1686	through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,

1687	but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,

1688	and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in

1689	some foreign country.

1690	

1691	The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a

1692	peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His

1693	voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a

1694	certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word

1695	and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:

1696	

1697	Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow’ry _beds_ of ease,

1698	

1699	Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro’ _blood_-y seas?

1700	

1701	He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church “sociables” he was

1702	always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies

1703	would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,

1704	and “wall” their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, “Words

1705	cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal

1706	earth.”

1707	

1708	After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into

1709	a bulletin-board, and read off “notices” of meetings and societies and

1710	things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of

1711	doom—a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,

1712	away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is

1713	to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.

1714	

1715	And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went

1716	into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the

1717	church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;

1718	for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United

1719	States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the

1720	President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed

1721	by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of

1722	European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light

1723	and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear

1724	withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with

1725	a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace

1726	and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a

1727	grateful harvest of good. Amen.

1728	

1729	There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.

1730	The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he

1731	only endured it—if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;

1732	he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not

1733	listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular

1734	route over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,

1735	his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered

1736	additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had

1737	lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by

1738	calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and

1739	polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with

1740	the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping

1741	its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they

1742	had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if

1743	it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s

1744	hands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul would

1745	be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going

1746	on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal

1747	forward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of

1748	war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.

1749	

1750	The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an

1751	argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod—and

1752	yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and

1753	thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly

1754	worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he

1755	always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything

1756	else about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested

1757	for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the

1758	assembling together of the world’s hosts at the millennium when the lion

1759	and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead

1760	them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle

1761	were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the

1762	principal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the

1763	thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,

1764	if it was a tame lion.

1765	

1766	Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.

1767	Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was

1768	a large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he called it. It

1769	was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to

1770	take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went

1771	floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went

1772	into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,

1773	unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out

1774	of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in

1775	the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came

1776	idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the

1777	quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the

1778	drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around

1779	it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew

1780	bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly

1781	snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy

1782	the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,

1783	and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent

1784	and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin

1785	descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,

1786	a flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards

1787	away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators

1788	shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and

1789	hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,

1790	and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a

1791	craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on

1792	it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his

1793	fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at

1794	it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But

1795	he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a

1796	fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close

1797	to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the

1798	beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony

1799	and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so

1800	did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew

1801	down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the

1802	home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was

1803	but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of

1804	light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang

1805	into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of

1806	distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.

1807	

1808	By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with

1809	suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.

1810	The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all

1811	possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest

1812	sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of

1813	unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson

1814	had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole

1815	congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.

1816	

1817	Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was

1818	some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety

1819	in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog

1820	should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in

1821	him to carry it off.

1822	

1823	

1824	

1825	

1826	CHAPTER VI

1827	

1828	

1829	MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found

1830	him so—because it began another week’s slow suffering in school. He

1831	generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,

1832	it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.

1833	

1834	Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was

1835	sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.

1836	He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated

1837	again. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he

1838	began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew

1839	feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly

1840	he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This

1841	was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a “starter,” as he

1842	called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that

1843	argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought

1844	he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.

1845	Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing

1846	the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or

1847	three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly

1848	drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.

1849	But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed

1850	well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable

1851	spirit.

1852	

1853	But Sid slept on unconscious.

1854	

1855	Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.

1856	

1857	No result from Sid.

1858	

1859	Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then

1860	swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.

1861	

1862	Sid snored on.

1863	

1864	Tom was aggravated. He said, “Sid, Sid!” and shook him. This course

1865	worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then

1866	brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.

1867	Tom went on groaning. Sid said:

1868	

1869	“Tom! Say, Tom!” [No response.] “Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,

1870	Tom?” And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.

1871	

1872	Tom moaned out:

1873	

1874	“Oh, don’t, Sid. Don’t joggle me.”

1875	

1876	“Why, what’s the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.”

1877	

1878	“No—never mind. It’ll be over by and by, maybe. Don’t call anybody.”

1879	

1880	“But I must! _Don’t_ groan so, Tom, it’s awful. How long you been this

1881	way?”

1882	

1883	“Hours. Ouch! Oh, don’t stir so, Sid, you’ll kill me.”

1884	

1885	“Tom, why didn’t you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, _don’t!_ It makes my flesh

1886	crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?”

1887	

1888	“I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you’ve ever done to

1889	me. When I’m gone—”

1890	

1891	“Oh, Tom, you ain’t dying, are you? Don’t, Tom—oh, don’t. Maybe—”

1892	

1893	“I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell ’em so, Sid. And Sid, you give

1894	my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that’s come to

1895	town, and tell her—”

1896	

1897	But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,

1898	now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had

1899	gathered quite a genuine tone.

1900	

1901	Sid flew downstairs and said:

1902	

1903	“Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom’s dying!”

1904	

1905	“Dying!”

1906	

1907	“Yes’m. Don’t wait—come quick!”

1908	

1909	“Rubbage! I don’t believe it!”

1910	

1911	But she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.

1912	And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the

1913	bedside she gasped out:

1914	

1915	“You, Tom! Tom, what’s the matter with you?”

1916	

1917	“Oh, auntie, I’m—”

1918	

1919	“What’s the matter with you—what is the matter with you, child?”

1920	

1921	“Oh, auntie, my sore toe’s mortified!”

1922	

1923	The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a

1924	little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:

1925	

1926	“Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and

1927	climb out of this.”

1928	

1929	The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a

1930	little foolish, and he said:

1931	

1932	“Aunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my

1933	tooth at all.”

1934	

1935	“Your tooth, indeed! What’s the matter with your tooth?”

1936	

1937	“One of them’s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.”

1938	

1939	“There, there, now, don’t begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.

1940	Well—your tooth _is_ loose, but you’re not going to die about that.

1941	Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.”

1942	

1943	Tom said:

1944	

1945	“Oh, please, auntie, don’t pull it out. It don’t hurt any more. I wish

1946	I may never stir if it does. Please don’t, auntie. I don’t want to stay

1947	home from school.”

1948	

1949	“Oh, you don’t, don’t you? So all this row was because you thought you’d

1950	get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so,

1951	and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your

1952	outrageousness.” By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old

1953	lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom’s tooth with a loop

1954	and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and

1955	suddenly thrust it almost into the boy’s face. The tooth hung dangling

1956	by the bedpost, now.

1957	

1958	But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after

1959	breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his

1960	upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable

1961	way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;

1962	and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and

1963	homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,

1964	and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain

1965	which he did not feel that it wasn’t anything to spit like Tom Sawyer;

1966	but another boy said, “Sour grapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled

1967	hero.

1968	

1969	Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry

1970	Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and

1971	dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless

1972	and vulgar and bad—and because all their children admired him so, and

1973	delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like

1974	him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied

1975	Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders

1976	not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.

1977	Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown

1978	men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat

1979	was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,

1980	when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons

1981	far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of

1982	the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged

1983	in the dirt when not rolled up.

1984	

1985	Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps

1986	in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to

1987	school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could

1988	go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it

1989	suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he

1990	pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring

1991	and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor

1992	put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything

1993	that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,

1994	hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.

1995	

1996	Tom hailed the romantic outcast:

1997	

1998	“Hello, Huckleberry!”

1999	

2000	“Hello yourself, and see how you like it.”

2001	

2002	“What’s that you got?”

2003	

2004	“Dead cat.”

2005	

2006	“Lemme see him, Huck. My, he’s pretty stiff. Where’d you get him?”

2007	

2008	“Bought him off’n a boy.”

2009	

2010	“What did you give?”

2011	

2012	“I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.”

2013	

2014	“Where’d you get the blue ticket?”

2015	

2016	“Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.”

2017	

2018	“Say—what is dead cats good for, Huck?”

2019	

2020	“Good for? Cure warts with.”

2021	

2022	“No! Is that so? I know something that’s better.”

2023	

2024	“I bet you don’t. What is it?”

2025	

2026	“Why, spunk-water.”

2027	

2028	“Spunk-water! I wouldn’t give a dern for spunk-water.”

2029	

2030	“You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? D’you ever try it?”

2031	

2032	“No, I hain’t. But Bob Tanner did.”

2033	

2034	“Who told you so!”

2035	

2036	“Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny

2037	told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the

2038	nigger told me. There now!”

2039	

2040	“Well, what of it? They’ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I

2041	don’t know _him_. But I never see a nigger that _wouldn’t_ lie. Shucks!

2042	Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.”

2043	

2044	“Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water

2045	was.”

2046	

2047	“In the daytime?”

2048	

2049	“Certainly.”

2050	

2051	“With his face to the stump?”

2052	

2053	“Yes. Least I reckon so.”

2054	

2055	“Did he say anything?”

2056	

2057	“I don’t reckon he did. I don’t know.”

2058	

2059	“Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool

2060	way as that! Why, that ain’t a-going to do any good. You got to go all

2061	by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there’s a

2062	spunk-water stump, and just as it’s midnight you back up against the stump

2063	and jam your hand in and say:

2064	

2065	‘Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water,

2066	swaller these warts,’

2067	

2068	and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then

2069	turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.

2070	Because if you speak the charm’s busted.”

2071	

2072	“Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner

2073	done.”

2074	

2075	“No, sir, you can bet he didn’t, becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this

2076	town; and he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d knowed how to work

2077	spunk-water. I’ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,

2078	Huck. I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got considerable many

2079	warts. Sometimes I take ’em off with a bean.”

2080	

2081	“Yes, bean’s good. I’ve done that.”

2082	

2083	“Have you? What’s your way?”

2084	

2085	“You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,

2086	and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig

2087	a hole and bury it ’bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the

2088	moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece

2089	that’s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to

2090	fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the

2091	wart, and pretty soon off she comes.”

2092	

2093	“Yes, that’s it, Huck—that’s it; though when you’re burying it if you

2094	say ‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!’ it’s better.

2095	That’s the way Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to Coonville and

2096	most everywheres. But say—how do you cure ’em with dead cats?”

2097	

2098	“Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard ’long about

2099	midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it’s

2100	midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can’t see

2101	’em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear ’em talk;

2102	and when they’re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after ’em

2103	and say, ‘Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I’m

2104	done with ye!’ That’ll fetch _any_ wart.”

2105	

2106	“Sounds right. D’you ever try it, Huck?”

2107	

2108	“No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.”

2109	

2110	“Well, I reckon it’s so, then. Becuz they say she’s a witch.”

2111	

2112	“Say! Why, Tom, I _know_ she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own

2113	self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he

2114	took up a rock, and if she hadn’t dodged, he’d a got her. Well, that

2115	very night he rolled off’n a shed wher’ he was a layin drunk, and broke

2116	his arm.”

2117	

2118	“Why, that’s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?”

2119	

2120	“Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right

2121	stiddy, they’re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when

2122	they mumble they’re saying the Lord’s Prayer backards.”

2123	

2124	“Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?”

2125	

2126	“To-night. I reckon they’ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.”

2127	

2128	“But they buried him Saturday. Didn’t they get him Saturday night?”

2129	

2130	“Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?—and

2131	_then_ it’s Sunday. Devils don’t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t

2132	reckon.”

2133	

2134	“I never thought of that. That’s so. Lemme go with you?”

2135	

2136	“Of course—if you ain’t afeard.”

2137	

2138	“Afeard! ’Tain’t likely. Will you meow?”

2139	

2140	“Yes—and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep’ me

2141	a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says

2142	‘Dern that cat!’ and so I hove a brick through his window—but don’t you

2143	tell.”

2144	

2145	“I won’t. I couldn’t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but

2146	I’ll meow this time. Say—what’s that?”

2147	

2148	“Nothing but a tick.”

2149	

2150	“Where’d you get him?”

2151	

2152	“Out in the woods.”

2153	

2154	“What’ll you take for him?”

2155	

2156	“I don’t know. I don’t want to sell him.”

2157	

2158	“All right. It’s a mighty small tick, anyway.”

2159	

2160	“Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don’t belong to them. I’m

2161	satisfied with it. It’s a good enough tick for me.”

2162	

2163	“Sho, there’s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of ’em if I wanted

2164	to.”

2165	

2166	“Well, why don’t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can’t. This is a

2167	pretty early tick, I reckon. It’s the first one I’ve seen this year.”

2168	

2169	“Say, Huck—I’ll give you my tooth for him.”

2170	

2171	“Less see it.”

2172	

2173	Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed

2174	it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:

2175	

2176	“Is it genuwyne?”

2177	

2178	Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.

2179	

2180	“Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s a trade.”

2181	

2182	Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the

2183	pinchbug’s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than

2184	before.

2185	

2186	When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in

2187	briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He

2188	hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like

2189	alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom

2190	arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The

2191	interruption roused him.

2192	

2193	“Thomas Sawyer!”

2194	

2195	Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.

2196	

2197	“Sir!”

2198	

2199	“Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?”

2200	

2201	Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of

2202	yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric

2203	sympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the

2204	girls’ side of the school-house. He instantly said:

2205	

2206	“_I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!_”

2207	

2208	The master’s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of

2209	study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his

2210	mind. The master said:

2211	

2212	“You—you did what?”

2213	

2214	“Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.”

2215	

2216	There was no mistaking the words.

2217	

2218	“Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever

2219	listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your

2220	jacket.”

2221	

2222	The master’s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches

2223	notably diminished. Then the order followed:

2224	

2225	“Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.”

2226	

2227	The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but

2228	in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe

2229	of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good

2230	fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched

2231	herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and

2232	whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the

2233	long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.

2234	

2235	By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur

2236	rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal

2237	furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, “made a mouth” at him

2238	and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she

2239	cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it

2240	away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less

2241	animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it

2242	remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please take it—I got more.” The

2243	girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw

2244	something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time

2245	the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began

2246	to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,

2247	apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt

2248	to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she

2249	gave in and hesitatingly whispered:

2250	

2251	“Let me see it.”

2252	

2253	Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends

2254	to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl’s

2255	interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything

2256	else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:

2257	

2258	“It’s nice—make a man.”

2259	

2260	The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He

2261	could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;

2262	she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:

2263	

2264	“It’s a beautiful man—now make me coming along.”

2265	

2266	Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed

2267	the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:

2268	

2269	“It’s ever so nice—I wish I could draw.”

2270	

2271	“It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll learn you.”

2272	

2273	“Oh, will you? When?”

2274	

2275	“At noon. Do you go home to dinner?”

2276	

2277	“I’ll stay if you will.”

2278	

2279	“Good—that’s a whack. What’s your name?”

2280	

2281	“Becky Thatcher. What’s yours? Oh, I know. It’s Thomas Sawyer.”

2282	

2283	“That’s the name they lick me by. I’m Tom when I’m good. You call me

2284	Tom, will you?”

2285	

2286	“Yes.”

2287	

2288	Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from

2289	the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom

2290	said:

2291	

2292	“Oh, it ain’t anything.”

2293	

2294	“Yes it is.”

2295	

2296	“No it ain’t. You don’t want to see.”

2297	

2298	“Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”

2299	

2300	“You’ll tell.”

2301	

2302	“No I won’t—deed and deed and double deed won’t.”

2303	

2304	“You won’t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?”

2305	

2306	“No, I won’t ever tell _any_body. Now let me.”

2307	

2308	“Oh, _you_ don’t want to see!”

2309	

2310	“Now that you treat me so, I _will_ see.” And she put her small hand

2311	upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in

2312	earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were

2313	revealed: “_I love you_.”

2314	

2315	“Oh, you bad thing!” And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and

2316	looked pleased, nevertheless.

2317	

2318	Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his

2319	ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the

2320	house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles

2321	from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful

2322	moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But

2323	although Tom’s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.

2324	

2325	As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but

2326	the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the

2327	reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and

2328	turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into

2329	continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and

2330	got “turned down,” by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought

2331	up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with

2332	ostentation for months.

2333	

2334	

2335	

2336	

2337	CHAPTER VII

2338	

2339	

2340	THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas

2341	wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed

2342	to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.

2343	There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.

2344	The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed

2345	the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the

2346	flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a

2347	shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds

2348	floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible

2349	but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom’s heart ached to be free, or

2350	else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.

2351	His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of

2352	gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively

2353	the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on

2354	the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that

2355	amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when

2356	he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and

2357	made him take a new direction.

2358	

2359	Tom’s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and

2360	now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in

2361	an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn

2362	friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a

2363	pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.

2364	The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were

2365	interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit

2366	of the tick. So he put Joe’s slate on the desk and drew a line down the

2367	middle of it from top to bottom.

2368	

2369	“Now,” said he, “as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and

2370	I’ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,

2371	you’re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.”

2372	

2373	“All right, go ahead; start him up.”

2374	

2375	The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe

2376	harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This

2377	change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with

2378	absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the

2379	two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all

2380	things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The

2381	tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as

2382	anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would

2383	have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom’s fingers would

2384	be twitching to begin, Joe’s pin would deftly head him off, and keep

2385	possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too

2386	strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in

2387	a moment. Said he:

2388	

2389	“Tom, you let him alone.”

2390	

2391	“I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.”

2392	

2393	“No, sir, it ain’t fair; you just let him alone.”

2394	

2395	“Blame it, I ain’t going to stir him much.”

2396	

2397	“Let him alone, I tell you.”

2398	

2399	“I won’t!”

2400	

2401	“You shall—he’s on my side of the line.”

2402	

2403	“Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?”

2404	

2405	“I don’t care whose tick he is—he’s on my side of the line, and you

2406	sha’n’t touch him.”

2407	

2408	“Well, I’ll just bet I will, though. He’s my tick and I’ll do what I

2409	blame please with him, or die!”

2410	

2411	A tremendous whack came down on Tom’s shoulders, and its duplicate on

2412	Joe’s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from

2413	the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been

2414	too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile

2415	before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.

2416	He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed

2417	his bit of variety to it.

2418	

2419	When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered

2420	in her ear:

2421	

2422	“Put on your bonnet and let on you’re going home; and when you get to

2423	the corner, give the rest of ’em the slip, and turn down through the

2424	lane and come back. I’ll go the other way and come it over ’em the same

2425	way.”

2426	

2427	So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with

2428	another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and

2429	when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they

2430	sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil

2431	and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising

2432	house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.

2433	Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:

2434	

2435	“Do you love rats?”

2436	

2437	“No! I hate them!”

2438	

2439	“Well, I do, too—_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your

2440	head with a string.”

2441	

2442	“No, I don’t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.”

2443	

2444	“Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.”

2445	

2446	“Do you? I’ve got some. I’ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give

2447	it back to me.”

2448	

2449	That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs

2450	against the bench in excess of contentment.

2451	

2452	“Was you ever at a circus?” said Tom.

2453	

2454	“Yes, and my pa’s going to take me again some time, if I’m good.”

2455	

2456	“I been to the circus three or four times—lots of times. Church ain’t

2457	shucks to a circus. There’s things going on at a circus all the time.

2458	I’m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.”

2459	

2460	“Oh, are you! That will be nice. They’re so lovely, all spotted up.”

2461	

2462	“Yes, that’s so. And they get slathers of money—most a dollar a day, Ben

2463	Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?”

2464	

2465	“What’s that?”

2466	

2467	“Why, engaged to be married.”

2468	

2469	“No.”

2470	

2471	“Would you like to?”

2472	

2473	“I reckon so. I don’t know. What is it like?”

2474	

2475	“Like? Why it ain’t like anything. You only just tell a boy you won’t

2476	ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that’s

2477	all. Anybody can do it.”

2478	

2479	“Kiss? What do you kiss for?”

2480	

2481	“Why, that, you know, is to—well, they always do that.”

2482	

2483	“Everybody?”

2484	

2485	“Why, yes, everybody that’s in love with each other. Do you remember

2486	what I wrote on the slate?”

2487	

2488	“Ye—yes.”

2489	

2490	“What was it?”

2491	

2492	“I sha’n’t tell you.”

2493	

2494	“Shall I tell _you_?”

2495	

2496	“Ye—yes—but some other time.”

2497	

2498	“No, now.”

2499	

2500	“No, not now—to-morrow.”

2501	

2502	“Oh, no, _now_. Please, Becky—I’ll whisper it, I’ll whisper it ever so

2503	easy.”

2504	

2505	Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about

2506	her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to

2507	her ear. And then he added:

2508	

2509	“Now you whisper it to me—just the same.”

2510	

2511	She resisted, for a while, and then said:

2512	

2513	“You turn your face away so you can’t see, and then I will. But you

2514	mustn’t ever tell anybody—_will_ you, Tom? Now you won’t, _will_ you?”

2515	

2516	“No, indeed, indeed I won’t. Now, Becky.”

2517	

2518	He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred

2519	his curls and whispered, “I—love—you!”

2520	

2521	Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,

2522	with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little

2523	white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:

2524	

2525	“Now, Becky, it’s all done—all over but the kiss. Don’t you be afraid

2526	of that—it ain’t anything at all. Please, Becky.” And he tugged at her

2527	apron and the hands.

2528	

2529	By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing

2530	with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and

2531	said:

2532	

2533	“Now it’s all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain’t

2534	ever to love anybody but me, and you ain’t ever to marry anybody but me,

2535	ever never and forever. Will you?”

2536	

2537	“No, I’ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I’ll never marry anybody

2538	but you—and you ain’t to ever marry anybody but me, either.”

2539	

2540	“Certainly. Of course. That’s _part_ of it. And always coming to school

2541	or when we’re going home, you’re to walk with me, when there ain’t

2542	anybody looking—and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because

2543	that’s the way you do when you’re engaged.”

2544	

2545	“It’s so nice. I never heard of it before.”

2546	

2547	“Oh, it’s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence—”

2548	

2549	The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.

2550	

2551	“Oh, Tom! Then I ain’t the first you’ve ever been engaged to!”

2552	

2553	The child began to cry. Tom said:

2554	

2555	“Oh, don’t cry, Becky, I don’t care for her any more.”

2556	

2557	“Yes, you do, Tom—you know you do.”

2558	

2559	Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and

2560	turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with

2561	soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was

2562	up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and

2563	uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping

2564	she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began

2565	to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle

2566	with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and

2567	entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with

2568	her face to the wall. Tom’s heart smote him. He went to her and stood a

2569	moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:

2570	

2571	“Becky, I—I don’t care for anybody but you.”

2572	

2573	No reply—but sobs.

2574	

2575	“Becky”—pleadingly. “Becky, won’t you say something?”

2576	

2577	More sobs.

2578	

2579	Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,

2580	and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:

2581	

2582	“Please, Becky, won’t you take it?”

2583	

2584	She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over

2585	the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently

2586	Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she

2587	flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:

2588	

2589	“Tom! Come back, Tom!”

2590	

2591	She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions

2592	but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid

2593	herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she

2594	had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross

2595	of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about

2596	her to exchange sorrows with.

2597	

2598

2600	

2601	CHAPTER VIII

2602	

2603	

2604	TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the

2605	track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed

2606	a small “branch” two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile

2607	superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later

2608	he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff

2609	Hill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the

2610	valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to

2611	the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.

2612	There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even

2613	stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken

2614	by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and

2615	this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the

2616	more profound. The boy’s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings

2617	were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows

2618	on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him

2619	that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy

2620	Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie

2621	and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through

2622	the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and

2623	nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a

2624	clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with

2625	it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant

2626	the best in the world, and been treated like a dog—like a very dog. She

2627	would be sorry some day—maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only

2628	die _temporarily_!

2629	

2630	But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained

2631	shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into

2632	the concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and

2633	disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away—ever so far away, into

2634	unknown countries beyond the seas—and never came back any more! How

2635	would she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only

2636	to fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights

2637	were an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was

2638	exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be

2639	a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.

2640	No—better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on

2641	the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the

2642	Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with

2643	feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy

2644	summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs

2645	of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was

2646	something gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it!

2647	_now_ his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable

2648	splendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!

2649	How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,

2650	black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying

2651	at the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear

2652	at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in

2653	his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson

2654	sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass

2655	at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,

2656	with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy

2657	the whisperings, “It’s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!—the Black Avenger of the

2658	Spanish Main!”

2659	

2660	Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from

2661	home and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore

2662	he must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.

2663	He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of

2664	it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He

2665	put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:

2666	

2667	“What hasn’t come here, come! What’s here, stay here!”

2668	

2669	Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it

2670	up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides

2671	were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom’s astonishment was bound-less!

2672	He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:

2673	

2674	“Well, that beats anything!”

2675	

2676	Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The

2677	truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and

2678	all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried

2679	a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a

2680	fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just

2681	used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered

2682	themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been

2683	separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.

2684	Tom’s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had

2685	many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing

2686	before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times

2687	before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He

2688	puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch

2689	had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself

2690	on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot

2691	with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and

2692	put his mouth close to this depression and called—

2693	

2694	“Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,

2695	doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!”

2696	

2697	The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a

2698	second and then darted under again in a fright.

2699	

2700	“He dasn’t tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.”

2701	

2702	He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he

2703	gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have

2704	the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a

2705	patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his

2706	treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing

2707	when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his

2708	pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:

2709	

2710	“Brother, go find your brother!”

2711	

2712	He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must

2713	have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last

2714	repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each

2715	other.

2716	

2717	Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green

2718	aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned

2719	a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,

2720	disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and

2721	in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,

2722	with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an

2723	answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way

2724	and that. He said cautiously—to an imaginary company:

2725	

2726	“Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.”

2727	

2728	Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.

2729	Tom called:

2730	

2731	“Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?”

2732	

2733	“Guy of Guisborne wants no man’s pass. Who art thou that—that—”

2734	

2735	“Dares to hold such language,” said Tom, prompting—for they talked “by

2736	the book,” from memory.

2737	

2738	“Who art thou that dares to hold such language?”

2739	

2740	“I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.”

2741	

2742	“Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute

2743	with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!”

2744	

2745	They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,

2746	struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful

2747	combat, “two up and two down.” Presently Tom said:

2748	

2749	“Now, if you’ve got the hang, go it lively!”

2750	

2751	So they “went it lively,” panting and perspiring with the work. By and

2752	by Tom shouted:

2753	

2754	“Fall! fall! Why don’t you fall?”

2755	

2756	“I sha’n’t! Why don’t you fall yourself? You’re getting the worst of

2757	it.”

2758	

2759	“Why, that ain’t anything. I can’t fall; that ain’t the way it is in the

2760	book. The book says, ‘Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy

2761	of Guisborne.’ You’re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.”

2762	

2763	There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the

2764	whack and fell.

2765	

2766	“Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got to let me kill _you_. That’s

2767	fair.”

2768	

2769	“Why, I can’t do that, it ain’t in the book.”

2770	

2771	“Well, it’s blamed mean—that’s all.”

2772	

2773	“Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller’s son, and lam

2774	me with a quarter-staff; or I’ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be

2775	Robin Hood a little while and kill me.”

2776	

2777	This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then

2778	Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to

2779	bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,

2780	representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,

2781	gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, “Where this arrow

2782	falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.” Then he

2783	shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle

2784	and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.

2785	

2786	The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off

2787	grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern

2788	civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.

2789	They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than

2790	President of the United States forever.

2791	

2792	

2793	

2794	

2795	CHAPTER IX

2796	

2797	

2798	AT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.

2799	They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and

2800	waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be

2801	nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He

2802	would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was

2803	afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.

2804	Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,

2805	scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking

2806	of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack

2807	mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.

2808	A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the

2809	tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,

2810	began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the

2811	bed’s head made Tom shudder—it meant that somebody’s days were numbered.

2812	Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered

2813	by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last

2814	he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to

2815	doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear

2816	it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most

2817	melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed

2818	him. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle

2819	against the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a

2820	single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping

2821	along the roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d” with caution once

2822	or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence

2823	to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys

2824	moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they

2825	were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.

2826	

2827	It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,

2828	about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence

2829	around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the

2830	time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the

2831	whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a

2832	tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over

2833	the graves, leaning for support and finding none. “Sacred to the memory

2834	of” So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have

2835	been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.

2836	

2837	A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the

2838	spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked

2839	little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the

2840	pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the

2841	sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the

2842	protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of

2843	the grave.

2844	

2845	Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of

2846	a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom’s

2847	reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a

2848	whisper:

2849	

2850	“Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?”

2851	

2852	Huckleberry whispered:

2853	

2854	“I wisht I knowed. It’s awful solemn like, _ain’t_ it?”

2855	

2856	“I bet it is.”

2857	

2858	There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter

2859	inwardly. Then Tom whispered:

2860	

2861	“Say, Hucky—do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?”

2862	

2863	“O’ course he does. Least his sperrit does.”

2864	

2865	Tom, after a pause:

2866	

2867	“I wish I’d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody

2868	calls him Hoss.”

2869	

2870	“A body can’t be too partic’lar how they talk ’bout these-yer dead

2871	people, Tom.”

2872	

2873	This was a damper, and conversation died again.

2874	

2875	Presently Tom seized his comrade’s arm and said:

2876	

2877	“Sh!”

2878	

2879	“What is it, Tom?” And the two clung together with beating hearts.

2880	

2881	“Sh! There ’tis again! Didn’t you hear it?”

2882	

2883	“I—”

2884	

2885	“There! Now you hear it.”

2886	

2887	“Lord, Tom, they’re coming! They’re coming, sure. What’ll we do?”

2888	

2889	“I dono. Think they’ll see us?”

2890	

2891	“Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn’t

2892	come.”

2893	

2894	“Oh, don’t be afeard. I don’t believe they’ll bother us. We ain’t doing

2895	any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won’t notice us at

2896	all.”

2897	

2898	“I’ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I’m all of a shiver.”

2899	

2900	“Listen!”

2901	

2902	The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled

2903	sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.

2904	

2905	“Look! See there!” whispered Tom. “What is it?”

2906	

2907	“It’s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.”

2908	

2909	Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an

2910	old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable

2911	little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a

2912	shudder:

2913	

2914	“It’s the devils sure enough. Three of ’em! Lordy, Tom, we’re goners!

2915	Can you pray?”

2916	

2917	“I’ll try, but don’t you be afeard. They ain’t going to hurt us. ‘Now I

2918	lay me down to sleep, I—’”

2919	

2920	“Sh!”

2921	

2922	“What is it, Huck?”

2923	

2924	“They’re _humans_! One of ’em is, anyway. One of ’em’s old Muff Potter’s

2925	voice.”

2926	

2927	“No—’tain’t so, is it?”

2928	

2929	“I bet I know it. Don’t you stir nor budge. He ain’t sharp enough to

2930	notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely—blamed old rip!”

2931	

2932	“All right, I’ll keep still. Now they’re stuck. Can’t find it. Here they

2933	come again. Now they’re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They’re

2934	p’inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o’ them voices; it’s

2935	Injun Joe.”

2936	

2937	“That’s so—that murderin’ half-breed! I’d druther they was devils a dern

2938	sight. What kin they be up to?”

2939	

2940	The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the

2941	grave and stood within a few feet of the boys’ hiding-place.

2942	

2943	“Here it is,” said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern

2944	up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.

2945	

2946	Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple

2947	of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.

2948	The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat

2949	down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the

2950	boys could have touched him.

2951	

2952	“Hurry, men!” he said, in a low voice; “the moon might come out at any

2953	moment.”

2954	

2955	They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no

2956	noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of

2957	mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon

2958	the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two

2959	the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with

2960	their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The

2961	moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.

2962	The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a

2963	blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large

2964	spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:

2965	

2966	“Now the cussed thing’s ready, Sawbones, and you’ll just out with

2967	another five, or here she stays.”

2968	

2969	“That’s the talk!” said Injun Joe.

2970	

2971	“Look here, what does this mean?” said the doctor. “You required your

2972	pay in advance, and I’ve paid you.”

2973	

2974	“Yes, and you done more than that,” said Injun Joe, approaching the

2975	doctor, who was now standing. “Five years ago you drove me away from

2976	your father’s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to

2977	eat, and you said I warn’t there for any good; and when I swore I’d get

2978	even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for

2979	a vagrant. Did you think I’d forget? The Injun blood ain’t in me for

2980	nothing. And now I’ve _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!”

2981	

2982	He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.

2983	The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.

2984	Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:

2985	

2986	“Here, now, don’t you hit my pard!” and the next moment he had grappled

2987	with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,

2988	trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe

2989	sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter’s

2990	knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about

2991	the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung

2992	himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams’ grave and felled

2993	Potter to the earth with it—and in the same instant the half-breed saw

2994	his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man’s breast. He

2995	reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in

2996	the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the

2997	two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.

2998	

2999	Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the

3000	two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave

3001	a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:

3002	

3003	“_That_ score is settled—damn you.”

3004	

3005	Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter’s

3006	open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three—four—five

3007	minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed

3008	upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a

3009	shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and

3010	then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe’s.

3011	

3012	“Lord, how is this, Joe?” he said.

3013	

3014	“It’s a dirty business,” said Joe, without moving.

3015	

3016	“What did you do it for?”

3017	

3018	“I! I never done it!”

3019	

3020	“Look here! That kind of talk won’t wash.”

3021	

3022	Potter trembled and grew white.

3023	

3024	“I thought I’d got sober. I’d no business to drink to-night. But it’s

3025	in my head yet—worse’n when we started here. I’m all in a muddle;

3026	can’t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe—_honest_, now,

3027	old feller—did I do it? Joe, I never meant to—’pon my soul and honor, I

3028	never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it’s awful—and him so

3029	young and promising.”

3030	

3031	“Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard

3032	and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering

3033	like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched

3034	you another awful clip—and here you’ve laid, as dead as a wedge til

3035	now.”

3036	

3037	“Oh, I didn’t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I

3038	did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.

3039	I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I’ve fought, but never

3040	with weepons. They’ll all say that. Joe, don’t tell! Say you won’t tell,

3041	Joe—that’s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you,

3042	too. Don’t you remember? You _won’t_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?” And the

3043	poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and

3044	clasped his appealing hands.

3045	

3046	“No, you’ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I

3047	won’t go back on you. There, now, that’s as fair as a man can say.”

3048	

3049	“Oh, Joe, you’re an angel. I’ll bless you for this the longest day I

3050	live.” And Potter began to cry.

3051	

3052	“Come, now, that’s enough of that. This ain’t any time for blubbering.

3053	You be off yonder way and I’ll go this. Move, now, and don’t leave any

3054	tracks behind you.”

3055	

3056	Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed

3057	stood looking after him. He muttered:

3058	

3059	“If he’s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he

3060	had the look of being, he won’t think of the knife till he’s gone so

3061	far he’ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by

3062	himself—chicken-heart!”

3063	

3064	Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the

3065	lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the

3066	moon’s. The stillness was complete again, too.

3067	

3068	

3069	

3070	

3071	CHAPTER X

3072	

3073	

3074	THE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with

3075	horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,

3076	apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump

3077	that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them

3078	catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay

3079	near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give

3080	wings to their feet.

3081	

3082	“If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!” whispered

3083	Tom, in short catches between breaths. “I can’t stand it much longer.”

3084	

3085	Huckleberry’s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed

3086	their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.

3087	They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst

3088	through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering

3089	shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:

3090	

3091	“Huckleberry, what do you reckon’ll come of this?”

3092	

3093	“If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging’ll come of it.”

3094	

3095	“Do you though?”

3096	

3097	“Why, I _know_ it, Tom.”

3098	

3099	Tom thought a while, then he said:

3100	

3101	“Who’ll tell? We?”

3102	

3103	“What are you talking about? S’pose something happened and Injun Joe

3104	_didn’t_ hang? Why, he’d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure

3105	as we’re a laying here.”

3106	

3107	“That’s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.”

3108	

3109	“If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he’s fool enough. He’s

3110	generally drunk enough.”

3111	

3112	Tom said nothing—went on thinking. Presently he whispered:

3113	

3114	“Huck, Muff Potter don’t know it. How can he tell?”

3115	

3116	“What’s the reason he don’t know it?”

3117	

3118	“Because he’d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D’you reckon

3119	he could see anything? D’you reckon he knowed anything?”

3120	

3121	“By hokey, that’s so, Tom!”

3122	

3123	“And besides, look-a-here—maybe that whack done for _him_!”

3124	

3125	“No, ’taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and

3126	besides, he always has. Well, when pap’s full, you might take and belt

3127	him over the head with a church and you couldn’t phase him. He says so,

3128	his own self. So it’s the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man

3129	was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.”

3130	

3131	After another reflective silence, Tom said:

3132	

3133	“Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?”

3134	

3135	“Tom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn’t

3136	make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak

3137	’bout this and they didn’t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take

3138	and swear to one another—that’s what we got to do—swear to keep mum.”

3139	

3140	“I’m agreed. It’s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear

3141	that we—”

3142	

3143	“Oh no, that wouldn’t do for this. That’s good enough for little

3144	rubbishy common things—specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you

3145	anyway, and blab if they get in a huff—but there orter be writing ’bout

3146	a big thing like this. And blood.”

3147	

3148	Tom’s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;

3149	the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.

3150	He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a

3151	little fragment of “red keel” out of his pocket, got the moon on

3152	his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow

3153	down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the

3154	pressure on the up-strokes. [See next page.]

3155	

3156	“Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They

3157	wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.”

3158	

3159	Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom’s facility in writing, and

3160	the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and

3161	was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:

3162	

3163	“Hold on! Don’t do that. A pin’s brass. It might have verdigrease on

3164	it.”

3165	

3166	“What’s verdigrease?”

3167	

3168	“It’s p’ison. That’s what it is. You just swaller some of it once—you’ll

3169	see.”

3170	

3171	So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked

3172	the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after

3173	many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his

3174	little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and

3175	an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the

3176	wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters

3177	that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown

3178	away.

3179	

3180	A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined

3181	building, now, but they did not notice it.

3182	

3183	“Tom,” whispered Huckleberry, “does this keep us from _ever_

3184	telling—_always_?”

3185	

3186	“Of course it does. It don’t make any difference _what_ happens, we got

3187	to keep mum. We’d drop down dead—don’t _you_ know that?”

3188	

3189	“Yes, I reckon that’s so.”

3190	

3191	They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up

3192	a long, lugubrious howl just outside—within ten feet of them. The boys

3193	clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.

3194	

3195	“Which of us does he mean?” gasped Huckleberry.

3196	

3197	“I dono—peep through the crack. Quick!”

3198	

3199	“No, _you_, Tom!”

3200	

3201	“I can’t—I can’t _do_ it, Huck!”

3202	

3203	“Please, Tom. There ’tis again!”

3204	

3205	“Oh, lordy, I’m thankful!” whispered Tom. “I know his voice. It’s Bull

3206	Harbison.” *

3207	

3208	[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of

3209	him as “Harbison’s Bull,” but a son or a dog of that name was “Bull

3210	Harbison.”]

3211	

3212	“Oh, that’s good—I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I’d a bet

3213	anything it was a _stray_ dog.”

3214	

3215	The dog howled again. The boys’ hearts sank once more.

3216	

3217	“Oh, my! that ain’t no Bull Harbison!” whispered Huckleberry. “_Do_,

3218	Tom!”

3219	

3220	Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His

3221	whisper was hardly audible when he said:

3222	

3223	“Oh, Huck, _its a stray dog_!”

3224	

3225	“Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?”

3226	

3227	“Huck, he must mean us both—we’re right together.”

3228	

3229	“Oh, Tom, I reckon we’re goners. I reckon there ain’t no mistake ’bout

3230	where _I’ll_ go to. I been so wicked.”

3231	

3232	“Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a

3233	feller’s told _not_ to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I’d a

3234	tried—but no, I wouldn’t, of course. But if ever I get off this time,

3235	I lay I’ll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools!” And Tom began to snuffle a

3236	little.

3237	

3238	“_You_ bad!” and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. “Consound it, Tom

3239	Sawyer, you’re just old pie, ’long-side o’ what I am. Oh, _lordy_,

3240	lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.”

3241	

3242	Tom choked off and whispered:

3243	

3244	“Look, Hucky, look! He’s got his _back_ to us!”

3245	

3246	Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.

3247	

3248	“Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?”

3249	

3250	“Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you

3251	know. _Now_ who can he mean?”

3252	

3253	The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.

3254	

3255	“Sh! What’s that?” he whispered.

3256	

3257	“Sounds like—like hogs grunting. No—it’s somebody snoring, Tom.”

3258	

3259	“That _is_ it! Where ’bouts is it, Huck?”

3260	

3261	“I bleeve it’s down at ’tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep

3262	there, sometimes, ’long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts

3263	things when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain’t ever coming back to

3264	this town any more.”

3265	

3266	The spirit of adventure rose in the boys’ souls once more.

3267	

3268	“Hucky, do you das’t to go if I lead?”

3269	

3270	“I don’t like to, much. Tom, s’pose it’s Injun Joe!”

3271	

3272	Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the

3273	boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their

3274	heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,

3275	the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the

3276	snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man

3277	moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was

3278	Muff Potter. The boys’ hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,

3279	when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,

3280	through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance

3281	to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night

3282	air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few

3283	feet of where Potter was lying, and _facing_ Potter, with his nose

3284	pointing heavenward.

3285	

3286	“Oh, geeminy, it’s _him_!” exclaimed both boys, in a breath.

3287	

3288	“Say, Tom—they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller’s

3289	house, ’bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come

3290	in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there

3291	ain’t anybody dead there yet.”

3292	

3293	“Well, I know that. And suppose there ain’t. Didn’t Gracie Miller fall

3294	in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?”

3295	

3296	“Yes, but she ain’t _dead_. And what’s more, she’s getting better, too.”

3297	

3298	“All right, you wait and see. She’s a goner, just as dead sure as Muff

3299	Potter’s a goner. That’s what the niggers say, and they know all about

3300	these kind of things, Huck.”

3301	

3302	Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window

3303	the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and

3304	fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He

3305	was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for

3306	an hour.

3307	

3308	When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the

3309	light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not

3310	been called—persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled

3311	him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,

3312	feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had

3313	finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted

3314	eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill

3315	to the culprit’s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it

3316	was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into

3317	silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.

3318	

3319	After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in

3320	the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt

3321	wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;

3322	and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs

3323	with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.

3324	This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom’s heart was sorer now

3325	than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform

3326	over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that

3327	he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble

3328	confidence.

3329	

3330	He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward

3331	Sid; and so the latter’s prompt retreat through the back gate was

3332	unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,

3333	along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the

3334	air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to

3335	trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his

3336	desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony

3337	stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.

3338	His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time

3339	he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with

3340	a sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal

3341	sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!

3342	

3343	This final feather broke the camel’s back.

3344	

3345	

3346	

3347	

3348	CHAPTER XI

3349	

3350	

3351	CLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified

3352	with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph;

3353	the tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,

3354	with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave

3355	holi-day for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of

3356	him if he had not.

3357	

3358	A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been

3359	recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter—so the story ran. And

3360	it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself

3361	in the “branch” about one or two o’clock in the morning, and that Potter

3362	had at once sneaked off—suspicious circumstances, especially the washing

3363	which was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had

3364	been ransacked for this “murderer” (the public are not slow in the

3365	matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he

3366	could not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every

3367	direction, and the Sheriff “was confident” that he would be captured

3368	before night.

3369	

3370	All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom’s heartbreak

3371	vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not

3372	a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,

3373	unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he

3374	wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.

3375	It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched

3376	his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry’s. Then both looked

3377	elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their

3378	mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly

3379	spectacle before them.

3380	

3381	“Poor fellow!” “Poor young fellow!” “This ought to be a lesson to grave

3382	robbers!” “Muff Potter’ll hang for this if they catch him!” This was the

3383	drift of remark; and the minister said, “It was a judgment; His hand is

3384	here.”

3385	

3386	Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid

3387	face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,

3388	and voices shouted, “It’s him! it’s him! he’s coming himself!”

3389	

3390	“Who? Who?” from twenty voices.

3391	

3392	“Muff Potter!”

3393	

3394	“Hallo, he’s stopped!—Look out, he’s turning! Don’t let him get away!”

3395	

3396	People in the branches of the trees over Tom’s head said he wasn’t

3397	trying to get away—he only looked doubtful and perplexed.

3398	

3399	“Infernal impudence!” said a bystander; “wanted to come and take a quiet

3400	look at his work, I reckon—didn’t expect any company.”

3401	

3402	The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously

3403	leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow’s face was haggard, and

3404	his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the

3405	murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands

3406	and burst into tears.

3407	

3408	“I didn’t do it, friends,” he sobbed; “’pon my word and honor I never

3409	done it.”

3410	

3411	“Who’s accused you?” shouted a voice.

3412	

3413	This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around

3414	him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and

3415	exclaimed:

3416	

3417	“Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you’d never—”

3418	

3419	“Is that your knife?” and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.

3420	

3421	Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the

3422	ground. Then he said:

3423	

3424	“Something told me ’t if I didn’t come back and get—” He shuddered; then

3425	waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, “Tell ’em,

3426	Joe, tell ’em—it ain’t any use any more.”

3427	

3428	Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the

3429	stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every

3430	moment that the clear sky would deliver God’s lightnings upon his head,

3431	and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had

3432	finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to

3433	break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner’s life faded and

3434	vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and

3435	it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.

3436	

3437	“Why didn’t you leave? What did you want to come here for?” somebody

3438	said.

3439	

3440	“I couldn’t help it—I couldn’t help it,” Potter moaned. “I wanted to

3441	run away, but I couldn’t seem to come anywhere but here.” And he fell to

3442	sobbing again.

3443	

3444	Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes

3445	afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the

3446	lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that

3447	Joe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most

3448	balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could

3449	not take their fascinated eyes from his face.

3450	

3451	They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should

3452	offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.

3453	

3454	Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in

3455	a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering

3456	crowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy

3457	circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were

3458	disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:

3459	

3460	“It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.”

3461	

3462	Tom’s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as

3463	much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:

3464	

3465	“Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me

3466	awake half the time.”

3467	

3468	Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.

3469	

3470	“It’s a bad sign,” said Aunt Polly, gravely. “What you got on your mind,

3471	Tom?”

3472	

3473	“Nothing. Nothing ’t I know of.” But the boy’s hand shook so that he

3474	spilled his coffee.

3475	

3476	“And you do talk such stuff,” Sid said. “Last night you said, ‘It’s

3477	blood, it’s blood, that’s what it is!’ You said that over and over.

3478	And you said, ‘Don’t torment me so—I’ll tell!’ Tell _what_? What is it

3479	you’ll tell?”

3480	

3481	Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have

3482	happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly’s face

3483	and she came to Tom’s relief without knowing it. She said:

3484	

3485	“Sho! It’s that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night

3486	myself. Sometimes I dream it’s me that done it.”

3487	

3488	Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.

3489	Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after

3490	that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every

3491	night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently

3492	slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good

3493	while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place

3494	again. Tom’s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew

3495	irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of

3496	Tom’s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.

3497	

3498	It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding

3499	inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.

3500	Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,

3501	though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;

3502	he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness—and that was strange;

3503	and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion

3504	to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,

3505	but said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and

3506	ceased to torture Tom’s conscience.

3507	

3508	Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his

3509	opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such

3510	small comforts through to the “murderer” as he could get hold of. The

3511	jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge

3512	of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it

3513	was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom’s

3514	conscience.

3515	

3516	The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride

3517	him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character

3518	that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the

3519	matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his

3520	inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery

3521	that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in

3522	the courts at present.

3523	

3524	

3525	

3526	

3527	CHAPTER XII

3528	

3529	

3530	ONE of the reasons why Tom’s mind had drifted away from its secret

3531	troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest

3532	itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had

3533	struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to “whistle her down the

3534	wind,” but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father’s

3535	house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she

3536	should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an

3537	interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there

3538	was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;

3539	there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to

3540	try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who

3541	are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of

3542	producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in

3543	these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a

3544	fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,

3545	but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the

3546	“Health” periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance

3547	they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the “rot” they

3548	contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,

3549	and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and

3550	what frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing

3551	to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her

3552	health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they

3553	had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest

3554	as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered

3555	together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed

3556	with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with

3557	“hell following after.” But she never suspected that she was not an

3558	angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering

3559	neighbors.

3560	

3561	The water treatment was new, now, and Tom’s low condition was a windfall

3562	to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the

3563	wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed

3564	him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she

3565	rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she

3566	sweated his soul clean and “the yellow stains of it came through his

3567	pores”—as Tom said.

3568	

3569	Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and

3570	pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and

3571	plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the

3572	water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his

3573	capacity as she would a jug’s, and filled him up every day with quack

3574	cure-alls.

3575	

3576	Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase

3577	filled the old lady’s heart with consternation. This indifference must

3578	be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first

3579	time. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with

3580	gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water

3581	treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.

3582	She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the

3583	result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;

3584	for the “indifference” was broken up. The boy could not have shown a

3585	wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.

3586	

3587	Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be

3588	romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have

3589	too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he

3590	thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of

3591	professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he

3592	became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and

3593	quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings

3594	to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle

3595	clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it

3596	did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in

3597	the sitting-room floor with it.

3598	

3599	One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt’s yellow

3600	cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging

3601	for a taste. Tom said:

3602	

3603	“Don’t ask for it unless you want it, Peter.”

3604	

3605	But Peter signified that he did want it.

3606	

3607	“You better make sure.”

3608	

3609	Peter was sure.

3610	

3611	“Now you’ve asked for it, and I’ll give it to you, because there ain’t

3612	anything mean about me; but if you find you don’t like it, you mustn’t

3613	blame anybody but your own self.”

3614	

3615	Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down

3616	the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then

3617	delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging

3618	against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next

3619	he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,

3620	with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his

3621	unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again

3622	spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time

3623	to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,

3624	and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots

3625	with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over

3626	her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.

3627	

3628	“Tom, what on earth ails that cat?”

3629	

3630	“I don’t know, aunt,” gasped the boy.

3631	

3632	“Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?”

3633	

3634	“Deed I don’t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they’re having a

3635	good time.”

3636	

3637	“They do, do they?” There was something in the tone that made Tom

3638	apprehensive.

3639	

3640	“Yes’m. That is, I believe they do.”

3641	

3642	“You _do_?”

3643	

3644	“Yes’m.”

3645	

3646	The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized

3647	by anxiety. Too late he divined her “drift.” The handle of the telltale

3648	tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it

3649	up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual

3650	handle—his ear—and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.

3651	

3652	“Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?”

3653	

3654	“I done it out of pity for him—because he hadn’t any aunt.”

3655	

3656	“Hadn’t any aunt!—you numskull. What has that got to do with it?”

3657	

3658	“Heaps. Because if he’d had one she’d a burnt him out herself! She’d a

3659	roasted his bowels out of him ’thout any more feeling than if he was a

3660	human!”

3661	

3662	Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in

3663	a new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too.

3664	She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she

3665	put her hand on Tom’s head and said gently:

3666	

3667	“I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.”

3668	

3669	Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping

3670	through his gravity.

3671	

3672	“I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It

3673	done _him_ good, too. I never see him get around so since—”

3674	

3675	“Oh, go ’long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try

3676	and see if you can’t be a good boy, for once, and you needn’t take any

3677	more medicine.”

3678	

3679	Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing

3680	had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,

3681	he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his

3682	comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to

3683	be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking—down the road.

3684	Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom’s face lighted; he gazed

3685	a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom

3686	accosted him; and “led up” warily to opportunities for remark about

3687	Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and

3688	watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the

3689	owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks

3690	ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered

3691	the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed

3692	in at the gate, and Tom’s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he

3693	was out, and “going on” like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,

3694	jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,

3695	standing on his head—doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,

3696	and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher

3697	was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never

3698	looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?

3699	He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping

3700	around, snatched a boy’s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,

3701	broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and

3702	fell sprawling, himself, under Becky’s nose, almost upsetting her—and

3703	she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: “Mf! some

3704	people think they’re mighty smart—always showing off!”

3705	

3706	Tom’s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and

3707	crestfallen.

3708

3712	CHAPTER XIII

3713	

3714	

3715	TOM’S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a

3716	forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out

3717	what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried

3718	to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing

3719	would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame

3720	_him_ for the consequences—why shouldn’t they? What right had the

3721	friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would

3722	lead a life of crime. There was no choice.

3723	

3724	By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to

3725	“take up” tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he

3726	should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more—it was very

3727	hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold

3728	world, he must submit—but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and

3729	fast.

3730	

3731	Just at this point he met his soul’s sworn comrade, Joe

3732	Harper—hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his

3733	heart. Plainly here were “two souls with but a single thought.” Tom,

3734	wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about

3735	a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by

3736	roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping

3737	that Joe would not forget him.

3738	

3739	But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going

3740	to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother

3741	had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and

3742	knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished

3743	him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but

3744	succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her

3745	poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.

3746	

3747	As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand

3748	by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved

3749	them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for

3750	being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying,

3751	some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he

3752	conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of

3753	crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.

3754	

3755	Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River

3756	was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,

3757	with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a

3758	rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further

3759	shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson’s

3760	Island was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a

3761	matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,

3762	and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was

3763	indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the

3764	river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour—which was

3765	midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.

3766	Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal

3767	in the most dark and mysterious way—as became outlaws. And before the

3768	afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of

3769	spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would “hear something.” All

3770	who got this vague hint were cautioned to “be mum and wait.”

3771	

3772	About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,

3773	and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the

3774	meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay

3775	like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the

3776	quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under

3777	the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the

3778	same way. Then a guarded voice said:

3779	

3780	“Who goes there?”

3781	

3782	“Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.”

3783	

3784	“Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.” Tom

3785	had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.

3786	

3787	“’Tis well. Give the countersign.”

3788	

3789	Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the

3790	brooding night:

3791	

3792	“_Blood_!”

3793	

3794	Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,

3795	tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was

3796	an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked

3797	the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.

3798	

3799	The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn

3800	himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a

3801	skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought

3802	a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or

3803	“chewed” but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it

3804	would never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;

3805	matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering

3806	upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily

3807	thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing

3808	adventure of it, saying, “Hist!” every now and then, and suddenly

3809	halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;

3810	and giving orders in dismal whispers that if “the foe” stirred, to “let

3811	him have it to the hilt,” because “dead men tell no tales.” They knew

3812	well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying

3813	in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their

3814	conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.

3815	

3816	They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and

3817	Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded

3818	arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:

3819	

3820	“Luff, and bring her to the wind!”

3821	

3822	“Aye-aye, sir!”

3823	

3824	“Steady, steady-y-y-y!”

3825	

3826	“Steady it is, sir!”

3827	

3828	“Let her go off a point!”

3829	

3830	“Point it is, sir!”

3831	

3832	As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream

3833	it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for

3834	“style,” and were not intended to mean anything in particular.

3835	

3836	“What sail’s she carrying?”

3837	

3838	“Courses, tops’ls, and flying-jib, sir.”

3839	

3840	“Send the r’yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of

3841	ye—foretopmaststuns’l! Lively, now!”

3842	

3843	“Aye-aye, sir!”

3844	

3845	“Shake out that maintogalans’l! Sheets and braces! _now_ my hearties!”

3846	

3847	“Aye-aye, sir!”

3848	

3849	“Hellum-a-lee—hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,

3850	port! _Now_, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!”

3851	

3852	“Steady it is, sir!”

3853	

3854	The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head

3855	right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was

3856	not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during

3857	the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before

3858	the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,

3859	peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,

3860	unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black

3861	Avenger stood still with folded arms, “looking his last” upon the scene

3862	of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing “she” could see

3863	him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless

3864	heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but

3865	a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond

3866	eye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last” with a broken and

3867	satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and

3868	they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift

3869	them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in

3870	time, and made shift to avert it. About two o’clock in the morning the

3871	raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,

3872	and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part

3873	of the little raft’s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they

3874	spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;

3875	but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as

3876	became outlaws.

3877	

3878	They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps

3879	within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in

3880	the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn “pone” stock

3881	they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,

3882	free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,

3883	far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to

3884	civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy

3885	glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the

3886	varnished foliage and festooning vines.

3887	

3888	When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance

3889	of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,

3890	filled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but

3891	they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting

3892	campfire.

3893	

3894	“_Ain’t_ it gay?” said Joe.

3895	

3896	“It’s _nuts_!” said Tom. “What would the boys say if they could see us?”

3897	

3898	“Say? Well, they’d just die to be here—hey, Hucky!”

3899	

3900	“I reckon so,” said Huckleberry; “anyways, I’m suited. I don’t want

3901	nothing better’n this. I don’t ever get enough to eat, gen’ally—and here

3902	they can’t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.”

3903	

3904	“It’s just the life for me,” said Tom. “You don’t have to get up,

3905	mornings, and you don’t have to go to school, and wash, and all that

3906	blame foolishness. You see a pirate don’t have to do _anything_, Joe,

3907	when he’s ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and

3908	then he don’t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.”

3909	

3910	“Oh yes, that’s so,” said Joe, “but I hadn’t thought much about it, you

3911	know. I’d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I’ve tried it.”

3912	

3913	“You see,” said Tom, “people don’t go much on hermits, nowadays, like

3914	they used to in old times, but a pirate’s always respected. And

3915	a hermit’s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put

3916	sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and—”

3917	

3918	“What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?” inquired Huck.

3919	

3920	“I dono. But they’ve _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You’d have to do

3921	that if you was a hermit.”

3922	

3923	“Dern’d if I would,” said Huck.

3924	

3925	“Well, what would you do?”

3926	

3927	“I dono. But I wouldn’t do that.”

3928	

3929	“Why, Huck, you’d _have_ to. How’d you get around it?”

3930	

3931	“Why, I just wouldn’t stand it. I’d run away.”

3932	

3933	“Run away! Well, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You’d be

3934	a disgrace.”

3935	

3936	The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished

3937	gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with

3938	tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of

3939	fragrant smoke—he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The

3940	other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to

3941	acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:

3942	

3943	“What does pirates have to do?”

3944	

3945	Tom said:

3946	

3947	“Oh, they have just a bully time—take ships and burn them, and get the

3948	money and bury it in awful places in their island where there’s ghosts

3949	and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships—make ’em walk a

3950	plank.”

3951	

3952	“And they carry the women to the island,” said Joe; “they don’t kill the

3953	women.”

3954	

3955	“No,” assented Tom, “they don’t kill the women—they’re too noble. And

3956	the women’s always beautiful, too.

3957	

3958	“And don’t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver

3959	and di’monds,” said Joe, with enthusiasm.

3960	

3961	“Who?” said Huck.

3962	

3963	“Why, the pirates.”

3964	

3965	Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.

3966	

3967	“I reckon I ain’t dressed fitten for a pirate,” said he, with a

3968	regretful pathos in his voice; “but I ain’t got none but these.”

3969	

3970	But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,

3971	after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand

3972	that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for

3973	wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.

3974	

3975	Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the

3976	eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the

3977	Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.

3978	The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had

3979	more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,

3980	and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them

3981	kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at

3982	all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they

3983	might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at

3984	once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an

3985	intruder came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. They began

3986	to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and

3987	next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.

3988	They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had

3989	purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not

3990	to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the

3991	end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking

3992	sweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such

3993	valuables was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against that

3994	in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in

3995	the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the

3996	crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously

3997	inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.

3998	

3999

4001	

4002	CHAPTER XIV

4003	

4004	

4005	WHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and

4006	rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool

4007	gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the

4008	deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not

4009	a sound obtruded upon great Nature’s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood

4010	upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,

4011	and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck

4012	still slept.

4013	

4014	Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently

4015	the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray

4016	of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life

4017	manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going

4018	to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came

4019	crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air

4020	from time to time and “sniffing around,” then proceeding again—for he

4021	was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own

4022	accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,

4023	by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to

4024	go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its

4025	curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom’s leg and

4026	began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad—for that meant that

4027	he was going to have a new suit of clothes—without the shadow of a

4028	doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,

4029	from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled

4030	manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,

4031	and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed

4032	the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and

4033	said, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your

4034	children’s alone,” and she took wing and went off to see about it—which

4035	did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was

4036	credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity

4037	more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and

4038	Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body

4039	and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A

4040	catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom’s head, and trilled

4041	out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then

4042	a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig

4043	almost within the boy’s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the

4044	strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow

4045	of the “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to

4046	inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never

4047	seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.

4048	All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight

4049	pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few

4050	butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.

4051	

4052	Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with

4053	a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and

4054	tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white

4055	sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the

4056	distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a

4057	slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only

4058	gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge

4059	between them and civilization.

4060	

4061	They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and

4062	ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a

4063	spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak

4064	or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood

4065	charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe

4066	was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a

4067	minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in

4068	their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time

4069	to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,

4070	a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish—provisions enough for quite a

4071	family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for

4072	no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the

4073	quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better

4074	he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,

4075	open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.

4076	

4077	They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,

4078	and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They

4079	tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,

4080	among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the

4081	ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came

4082	upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.

4083	

4084	They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be

4085	astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles

4086	long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to

4087	was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards

4088	wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle

4089	of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to

4090	stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw

4091	themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,

4092	and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,

4093	and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.

4094	They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This

4095	took dim shape, presently—it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the

4096	Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they

4097	were all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak

4098	his thought.

4099	

4100	For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar

4101	sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a

4102	clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound

4103	became more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,

4104	glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There

4105	was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came

4106	floating down out of the distance.

4107	

4108	“What is it!” exclaimed Joe, under his breath.

4109	

4110	“I wonder,” said Tom in a whisper.

4111	

4112	“’Tain’t thunder,” said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, “becuz thunder—”

4113	

4114	“Hark!” said Tom. “Listen—don’t talk.”

4115	

4116	They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom

4117	troubled the solemn hush.

4118	

4119	“Let’s go and see.”

4120	

4121	They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They

4122	parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little

4123	steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the

4124	current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great

4125	many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood

4126	of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in

4127	them were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the

4128	ferryboat’s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same

4129	dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.

4130	

4131	“I know now!” exclaimed Tom; “somebody’s drownded!”

4132	

4133	“That’s it!” said Huck; “they done that last summer, when Bill Turner

4134	got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes

4135	him come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put

4136	quicksilver in ’em and set ’em afloat, and wherever there’s anybody

4137	that’s drownded, they’ll float right there and stop.”

4138	

4139	“Yes, I’ve heard about that,” said Joe. “I wonder what makes the bread

4140	do that.”

4141	

4142	“Oh, it ain’t the bread, so much,” said Tom; “I reckon it’s mostly what

4143	they _say_ over it before they start it out.”

4144	

4145	“But they don’t say anything over it,” said Huck. “I’ve seen ’em and

4146	they don’t.”

4147	

4148	“Well, that’s funny,” said Tom. “But maybe they say it to themselves. Of

4149	_course_ they do. Anybody might know that.”

4150	

4151	The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because

4152	an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not

4153	be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such

4154	gravity.

4155	

4156	“By jings, I wish I was over there, now,” said Joe.

4157	

4158	“I do too” said Huck “I’d give heaps to know who it is.”

4159	

4160	The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought

4161	flashed through Tom’s mind, and he exclaimed:

4162	

4163	“Boys, I know who’s drownded—it’s us!”

4164	

4165	They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they

4166	were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;

4167	tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor

4168	lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being

4169	indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,

4170	and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was

4171	concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.

4172	

4173	As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business

4174	and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were

4175	jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble

4176	they were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then

4177	fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;

4178	and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were

4179	gratifying to look upon—from their point of view. But when the shadows

4180	of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing

4181	into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The

4182	excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts

4183	of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as

4184	much as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a

4185	sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a

4186	roundabout “feeler” as to how the others might look upon a return to

4187	civilization—not right now, but—

4188	

4189	Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined

4190	in with Tom, and the waverer quickly “explained,” and was glad to get

4191	out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness

4192	clinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to

4193	rest for the moment.

4194	

4195	As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.

4196	Joe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,

4197	watching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,

4198	and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung

4199	by the campfire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders

4200	of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed

4201	to suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something

4202	upon each of these with his “red keel”; one he rolled up and put in his

4203	jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe’s hat and removed it to a

4204	little distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain

4205	schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value—among them a lump of

4206	chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind

4207	of marbles known as a “sure ’nough crystal.” Then he tiptoed his way

4208	cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and

4209	straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.

4210	

4211	

4212	

4213	

4214	CHAPTER XV

4215	

4216	

4217	A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward

4218	the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway

4219	over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out

4220	confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering

4221	upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had

4222	expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till

4223	he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket

4224	pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,

4225	following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten

4226	o’clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the

4227	ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything

4228	was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching

4229	with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes

4230	and climbed into the skiff that did “yawl” duty at the boat’s stern. He

4231	laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.

4232	

4233	Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to “cast

4234	off.” A minute or two later the skiff’s head was standing high up,

4235	against the boat’s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in

4236	his success, for he knew it was the boat’s last trip for the night. At

4237	the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and

4238	Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards

4239	downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.

4240	

4241	He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his

4242	aunt’s back fence. He climbed over, approached the “ell,” and looked

4243	in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There

4244	sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper’s mother, grouped together,

4245	talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the

4246	door. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then

4247	he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing

4248	cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might

4249	squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,

4250	warily.

4251	

4252	“What makes the candle blow so?” said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. “Why,

4253	that door’s open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange

4254	things now. Go ’long and shut it, Sid.”

4255	

4256	Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and “breathed”

4257	 himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his

4258	aunt’s foot.

4259	

4260	“But as I was saying,” said Aunt Polly, “he warn’t _bad_, so to say—only

4261	misch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn’t

4262	any more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was

4263	the best-hearted boy that ever was”—and she began to cry.

4264	

4265	“It was just so with my Joe—always full of his devilment, and up to

4266	every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he

4267	could be—and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking

4268	that cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because

4269	it was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never,

4270	never, poor abused boy!” And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would

4271	break.

4272	

4273	“I hope Tom’s better off where he is,” said Sid, “but if he’d been

4274	better in some ways—”

4275	

4276	“_Sid!_” Tom felt the glare of the old lady’s eye, though he could not

4277	see it. “Not a word against my Tom, now that he’s gone! God’ll take care

4278	of _him_—never you trouble _your_self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don’t

4279	know how to give him up! I don’t know how to give him up! He was such a

4280	comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, ’most.”

4281	

4282	“The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away—Blessed be the name of

4283	the Lord! But it’s so hard—Oh, it’s so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe

4284	busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.

4285	Little did I know then, how soon—Oh, if it was to do over again I’d hug

4286	him and bless him for it.”

4287	

4288	“Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just

4289	exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took

4290	and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would

4291	tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom’s head with my

4292	thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he’s out of all his troubles now.

4293	And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach—”

4294	

4295	But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely

4296	down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself—and more in pity of himself than

4297	anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word

4298	for him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself

4299	than ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt’s grief

4300	to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy—and

4301	the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his

4302	nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.

4303	

4304	He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was

4305	conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;

4306	then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing

4307	lads had promised that the village should “hear something” soon; the

4308	wise-heads had “put this and that together” and decided that the lads

4309	had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,

4310	presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the

4311	Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village—and then hope

4312	perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home

4313	by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the

4314	bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must

4315	have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would

4316	otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies

4317	continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the

4318	funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.

4319	

4320	Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a

4321	mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other’s

4322	arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was

4323	tender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid

4324	snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.

4325	

4326	Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,

4327	and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,

4328	that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.

4329	

4330	He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making

4331	broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and

4332	turning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her

4333	sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the

4334	candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full

4335	of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the

4336	candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.

4337	His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark

4338	hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and

4339	straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.

4340	

4341	He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large

4342	there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was

4343	tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and

4344	slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped

4345	into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a

4346	mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself

4347	stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for

4348	this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture

4349	the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore

4350	legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be

4351	made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and

4352	entered the woods.

4353	

4354	He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep

4355	awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far

4356	spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the

4357	island bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the

4358	great river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A

4359	little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and

4360	heard Joe say:

4361	

4362	“No, Tom’s true-blue, Huck, and he’ll come back. He won’t desert. He

4363	knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom’s too proud for that

4364	sort of thing. He’s up to something or other. Now I wonder what?”

4365	

4366	“Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain’t they?”

4367	

4368	“Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain’t

4369	back here to breakfast.”

4370	

4371	“Which he is!” exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping

4372	grandly into camp.

4373	

4374	A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the

4375	boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.

4376	They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.

4377	Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the

4378	other pirates got ready to fish and explore.

4379	

4380	

4381	

4382	

4383	CHAPTER XVI

4384	

4385	

4386	AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.

4387	They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft

4388	place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes

4389	they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly

4390	round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a

4391	famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.

4392	

4393	After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and

4394	chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until

4395	they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal

4396	water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their

4397	legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.

4398	And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each

4399	other’s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with

4400	averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and

4401	struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all

4402	went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,

4403	sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.

4404	

4405	When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,

4406	hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by

4407	break for the water again and go through the original performance once

4408	more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented

4409	flesh-colored “tights” very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and

4410	had a circus—with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest

4411	post to his neighbor.

4412	

4413	Next they got their marbles and played “knucks” and “ringtaw” and

4414	“keeps” till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another

4415	swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off

4416	his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his

4417	ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the

4418	protection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he

4419	had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to

4420	rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the “dumps,” and

4421	fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay

4422	drowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing “BECKY” in the sand with

4423	his big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his

4424	weakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He

4425	erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving

4426	the other boys together and joining them.

4427	

4428	But Joe’s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so

4429	homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay

4430	very near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,

4431	but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready

4432	to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he

4433	would have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:

4434	

4435	“I bet there’s been pirates on this island before, boys. We’ll explore

4436	it again. They’ve hid treasures here somewhere. How’d you feel to light

4437	on a rotten chest full of gold and silver—hey?”

4438	

4439	But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.

4440	Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was

4441	discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking

4442	very gloomy. Finally he said:

4443	

4444	“Oh, boys, let’s give it up. I want to go home. It’s so lonesome.”

4445	

4446	“Oh no, Joe, you’ll feel better by and by,” said Tom. “Just think of the

4447	fishing that’s here.”

4448	

4449	“I don’t care for fishing. I want to go home.”

4450	

4451	“But, Joe, there ain’t such another swimming-place anywhere.”

4452	

4453	“Swimming’s no good. I don’t seem to care for it, somehow, when there

4454	ain’t anybody to say I sha’n’t go in. I mean to go home.”

4455	

4456	“Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.”

4457	

4458	“Yes, I _do_ want to see my mother—and you would, too, if you had one. I

4459	ain’t any more baby than you are.” And Joe snuffled a little.

4460	

4461	“Well, we’ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won’t we, Huck? Poor

4462	thing—does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here,

4463	don’t you, Huck? We’ll stay, won’t we?”

4464	

4465	Huck said, “Y-e-s”—without any heart in it.

4466	

4467	“I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live,” said Joe, rising.

4468	“There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.

4469	

4470	“Who cares!” said Tom. “Nobody wants you to. Go ’long home and get

4471	laughed at. Oh, you’re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain’t crybabies. We’ll

4472	stay, won’t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get

4473	along without him, per’aps.”

4474	

4475	But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly

4476	on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying

4477	Joe’s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.

4478	Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the

4479	Illinois shore. Tom’s heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck

4480	could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:

4481	

4482	“I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now

4483	it’ll be worse. Let’s us go, too, Tom.”

4484	

4485	“I won’t! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.”

4486	

4487	“Tom, I better go.”

4488	

4489	“Well, go ’long—who’s hendering you.”

4490	

4491	Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:

4492	

4493	“Tom, I wisht you’d come, too. Now you think it over. We’ll wait for you

4494	when we get to shore.”

4495	

4496	“Well, you’ll wait a blame long time, that’s all.”

4497	

4498	Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a

4499	strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along

4500	too. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It

4501	suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made

4502	one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades,

4503	yelling:

4504	

4505	“Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!”

4506	

4507	They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they

4508	were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till

4509	at last they saw the “point” he was driving at, and then they set up a

4510	warwhoop of applause and said it was “splendid!” and said if he had

4511	told them at first, they wouldn’t have started away. He made a plausible

4512	excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret

4513	would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had

4514	meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.

4515	

4516	The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,

4517	chattering all the time about Tom’s stupendous plan and admiring the

4518	genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to

4519	learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to

4520	try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never

4521	smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they “bit” the

4522	tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.

4523	

4524	Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,

4525	charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,

4526	and they gagged a little, but Tom said:

4527	

4528	“Why, it’s just as easy! If I’d a knowed this was all, I’d a learnt long

4529	ago.”

4530	

4531	“So would I,” said Joe. “It’s just nothing.”

4532	

4533	“Why, many a time I’ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish

4534	I could do that; but I never thought I could,” said Tom.

4535	

4536	“That’s just the way with me, hain’t it, Huck? You’ve heard me talk just

4537	that way—haven’t you, Huck? I’ll leave it to Huck if I haven’t.”

4538	

4539	“Yes—heaps of times,” said Huck.

4540	

4541	“Well, I have too,” said Tom; “oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the

4542	slaughter-house. Don’t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and

4543	Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don’t you remember,

4544	Huck, ’bout me saying that?”

4545	

4546	“Yes, that’s so,” said Huck. “That was the day after I lost a white

4547	alley. No, ’twas the day before.”

4548	

4549	“There—I told you so,” said Tom. “Huck recollects it.”

4550	

4551	“I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,” said Joe. “I don’t feel

4552	sick.”

4553	

4554	“Neither do I,” said Tom. “I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff

4555	Thatcher couldn’t.”

4556	

4557	“Jeff Thatcher! Why, he’d keel over just with two draws. Just let him

4558	try it once. _He’d_ see!”

4559	

4560	“I bet he would. And Johnny Miller—I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle

4561	it once.”

4562	

4563	“Oh, don’t I!” said Joe. “Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn’t any more

4564	do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.”

4565	

4566	“’Deed it would, Joe. Say—I wish the boys could see us now.”

4567	

4568	“So do I.”

4569	

4570	“Say—boys, don’t say anything about it, and some time when they’re

4571	around, I’ll come up to you and say, ‘Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.’

4572	And you’ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn’t anything, you’ll

4573	say, ‘Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain’t

4574	very good.’ And I’ll say, ‘Oh, that’s all right, if it’s _strong_

4575	enough.’ And then you’ll out with the pipes, and we’ll light up just as

4576	ca’m, and then just see ’em look!”

4577	

4578	“By jings, that’ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!”

4579	

4580	“So do I! And when we tell ’em we learned when we was off pirating,

4581	won’t they wish they’d been along?”

4582	

4583	“Oh, I reckon not! I’ll just _bet_ they will!”

4584	

4585	So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and

4586	grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously

4587	increased. Every pore inside the boys’ cheeks became a spouting

4588	fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues

4589	fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their

4590	throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings

4591	followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,

4592	now. Joe’s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom’s followed. Both

4593	fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and

4594	main. Joe said feebly:

4595	

4596	“I’ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.”

4597	

4598	Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:

4599	

4600	“I’ll help you. You go over that way and I’ll hunt around by the spring.

4601	No, you needn’t come, Huck—we can find it.”

4602	

4603	So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,

4604	and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both

4605	very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had

4606	had any trouble they had got rid of it.

4607	

4608	They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,

4609	and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare

4610	theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well—something they ate

4611	at dinner had disagreed with them.

4612	

4613	About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding

4614	oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys

4615	huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of

4616	the fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was

4617	stifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.

4618	Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the

4619	blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that

4620	vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by

4621	another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came

4622	sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting

4623	breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit

4624	of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned

4625	night into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and

4626	distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,

4627	startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling

4628	down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A

4629	sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the

4630	flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the

4631	forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops

4632	right over the boys’ heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick

4633	gloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.

4634	

4635	“Quick! boys, go for the tent!” exclaimed Tom.

4636	

4637	They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no

4638	two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through

4639	the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after

4640	another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching

4641	rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the

4642	ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the

4643	booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one

4644	they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,

4645	and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something

4646	to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so

4647	furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest

4648	rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its

4649	fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each

4650	others’ hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter

4651	of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its

4652	highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed

4653	in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless

4654	distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the

4655	driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on

4656	the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting

4657	veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight

4658	and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging

4659	thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,

4660	and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort

4661	that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to

4662	the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one

4663	and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be

4664	out in.

4665	

4666	But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and

4667	weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The

4668	boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still

4669	something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter

4670	of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were

4671	not under it when the catastrophe happened.

4672	

4673	Everything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but

4674	heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against

4675	rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and

4676	chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently

4677	discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had

4678	been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from

4679	the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they

4680	patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under

4681	sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they

4682	piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were

4683	gladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,

4684	and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their

4685	midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep

4686	on, anywhere around.

4687	

4688	As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over

4689	them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got

4690	scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After

4691	the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once

4692	more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as

4693	he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or

4694	anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of

4695	cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was

4696	to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.

4697	They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were

4698	stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many

4699	zebras—all of them chiefs, of course—and then they went tearing through

4700	the woods to attack an English settlement.

4701	

4702	By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each

4703	other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each

4704	other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely

4705	satisfactory one.

4706	

4707	They assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now

4708	a difficulty arose—hostile Indians could not break the bread of

4709	hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple

4710	impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other

4711	process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished

4712	they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such

4713	show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and

4714	took their whiff as it passed, in due form.

4715	

4716	And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had

4717	gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without

4718	having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to

4719	be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high

4720	promise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper,

4721	with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were

4722	prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been

4723	in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to

4724	smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at

4725	present.

4726	

4727	

4728	

4729	

4730	CHAPTER XVII

4731	

4732	

4733	BUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday

4734	afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly’s family, were being put into

4735	mourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed

4736	the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.

4737	The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked

4738	little; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to

4739	the children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them

4740	up.

4741	

4742	In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted

4743	schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing

4744	there to comfort her. She soliloquized:

4745	

4746	“Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven’t got

4747	anything now to remember him by.” And she choked back a little sob.

4748	

4749	Presently she stopped, and said to herself:

4750	

4751	“It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn’t say

4752	that—I wouldn’t say it for the whole world. But he’s gone now; I’ll

4753	never, never, never see him any more.”

4754	

4755	This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling

4756	down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls—playmates of Tom’s

4757	and Joe’s—came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking

4758	in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw

4759	him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful

4760	prophecy, as they could easily see now!)—and each speaker pointed out

4761	the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added

4762	something like “and I was a-standing just so—just as I am now, and as if

4763	you was him—I was as close as that—and he smiled, just this way—and then

4764	something seemed to go all over me, like—awful, you know—and I never

4765	thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!”

4766	

4767	Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and

4768	many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or

4769	less tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided

4770	who _did_ see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,

4771	the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance,

4772	and were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had

4773	no other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the

4774	remembrance:

4775	

4776	“Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.”

4777	

4778	But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,

4779	and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away,

4780	still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.

4781	

4782	When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell

4783	began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still

4784	Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush

4785	that lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment

4786	in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there

4787	was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses

4788	as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None

4789	could remember when the little church had been so full before. There

4790	was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly

4791	entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in

4792	deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose

4793	reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.

4794	There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled

4795	sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving

4796	hymn was sung, and the text followed: “I am the Resurrection and the

4797	Life.”

4798	

4799	As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the

4800	graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that

4801	every soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang

4802	in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always

4803	before, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor

4804	boys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the

4805	departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the

4806	people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes

4807	were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had

4808	seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation

4809	became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last

4810	the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus

4811	of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and

4812	crying in the pulpit.

4813	

4814	There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later

4815	the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above

4816	his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair

4817	of eyes followed the minister’s, and then almost with one impulse the

4818	congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up

4819	the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags,

4820	sneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery

4821	listening to their own funeral sermon!

4822	

4823	Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored

4824	ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while

4825	poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what

4826	to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and

4827	started to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:

4828	

4829	“Aunt Polly, it ain’t fair. Somebody’s got to be glad to see Huck.”

4830	

4831	“And so they shall. I’m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!” And

4832	the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing

4833	capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.

4834	

4835	Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: “Praise God from

4836	whom all blessings flow—_sing_!—and put your hearts in it!”

4837	

4838	And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and

4839	while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the

4840	envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the

4841	proudest moment of his life.

4842	

4843	As the “sold” congregation trooped out they said they would almost be

4844	willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that

4845	once more.

4846	

4847	Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day—according to Aunt Polly’s varying

4848	moods—than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which

4849	expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.

4850	

4851	

4852	

4853	

4854	CHAPTER XVIII

4855	

4856	

4857	THAT was Tom’s great secret—the scheme to return home with his brother

4858	pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the

4859	Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles

4860	below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town

4861	till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys

4862	and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of

4863	invalided benches.

4864	

4865	At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to

4866	Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of

4867	talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:

4868	

4869	“Well, I don’t say it wasn’t a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody

4870	suffering ’most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you

4871	could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over

4872	on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a

4873	hint some way that you warn’t dead, but only run off.”

4874	

4875	“Yes, you could have done that, Tom,” said Mary; “and I believe you

4876	would if you had thought of it.”

4877	

4878	“Would you, Tom?” said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. “Say,

4879	now, would you, if you’d thought of it?”

4880	

4881	“I—well, I don’t know. ’Twould ’a’ spoiled everything.”

4882	

4883	“Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,” said Aunt Polly, with a grieved

4884	tone that discomforted the boy. “It would have been something if you’d

4885	cared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn’t _do_ it.”

4886	

4887	“Now, auntie, that ain’t any harm,” pleaded Mary; “it’s only Tom’s giddy

4888	way—he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.”

4889	

4890	“More’s the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and

4891	_done_ it, too. Tom, you’ll look back, some day, when it’s too late,

4892	and wish you’d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so

4893	little.”

4894	

4895	“Now, auntie, you know I do care for you,” said Tom.

4896	

4897	“I’d know it better if you acted more like it.”

4898	

4899	“I wish now I’d thought,” said Tom, with a repentant tone; “but I dreamt

4900	about you, anyway. That’s something, ain’t it?”

4901	

4902	“It ain’t much—a cat does that much—but it’s better than nothing. What

4903	did you dream?”

4904	

4905	“Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the

4906	bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.”

4907	

4908	“Well, so we did. So we always do. I’m glad your dreams could take even

4909	that much trouble about us.”

4910	

4911	“And I dreamt that Joe Harper’s mother was here.”

4912	

4913	“Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?”

4914	

4915	“Oh, lots. But it’s so dim, now.”

4916	

4917	“Well, try to recollect—can’t you?”

4918	

4919	“Somehow it seems to me that the wind—the wind blowed the—the—”

4920	

4921	“Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!”

4922	

4923	Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then

4924	said:

4925	

4926	“I’ve got it now! I’ve got it now! It blowed the candle!”

4927	

4928	“Mercy on us! Go on, Tom—go on!”

4929	

4930	“And it seems to me that you said, ‘Why, I believe that that door—’”

4931	

4932	“Go _on_, Tom!”

4933	

4934	“Just let me study a moment—just a moment. Oh, yes—you said you believed

4935	the door was open.”

4936	

4937	“As I’m sitting here, I did! Didn’t I, Mary! Go on!”

4938	

4939	“And then—and then—well I won’t be certain, but it seems like as if you

4940	made Sid go and—and—”

4941	

4942	“Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?”

4943	

4944	“You made him—you—Oh, you made him shut it.”

4945	

4946	“Well, for the land’s sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my

4947	days! Don’t tell _me_ there ain’t anything in dreams, any more. Sereny

4948	Harper shall know of this before I’m an hour older. I’d like to see her

4949	get around _this_ with her rubbage ’bout superstition. Go on, Tom!”

4950	

4951	“Oh, it’s all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn’t

4952	_bad_, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible

4953	than—than—I think it was a colt, or something.”

4954	

4955	“And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!”

4956	

4957	“And then you began to cry.”

4958	

4959	“So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then—”

4960	

4961	“Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and

4962	she wished she hadn’t whipped him for taking cream when she’d throwed it

4963	out her own self—”

4964	

4965	“Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying—that’s what you

4966	was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!”

4967	

4968	“Then Sid he said—he said—”

4969	

4970	“I don’t think I said anything,” said Sid.

4971	

4972	“Yes you did, Sid,” said Mary.

4973	

4974	“Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?”

4975	

4976	“He said—I _think_ he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone

4977	to, but if I’d been better sometimes—”

4978	

4979	“_There_, d’you hear that! It was his very words!”

4980	

4981	“And you shut him up sharp.”

4982	

4983	“I lay I did! There must ’a’ been an angel there. There _was_ an angel

4984	there, somewheres!”

4985	

4986	“And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you

4987	told about Peter and the Pain-killer—”

4988	

4989	“Just as true as I live!”

4990	

4991	“And then there was a whole lot of talk ’bout dragging the river for us,

4992	and ’bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper

4993	hugged and cried, and she went.”

4994	

4995	“It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I’m a-sitting in

4996	these very tracks. Tom, you couldn’t told it more like if you’d ’a’ seen

4997	it! And then what? Go on, Tom!”

4998	

4999	“Then I thought you prayed for me—and I could see you and hear every

5000	word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and

5001	wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, ‘We ain’t dead—we are only off being

5002	pirates,’ and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked

5003	so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and

5004	kissed you on the lips.”

5005	

5006	“Did you, Tom, _did_ you! I just forgive you everything for that!” And

5007	she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the

5008	guiltiest of villains.

5009	

5010	“It was very kind, even though it was only a—dream,” Sid soliloquized

5011	just audibly.

5012	

5013	“Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he’d do if he was

5014	awake. Here’s a big Milum apple I’ve been saving for you, Tom, if you

5015	was ever found again—now go ’long to school. I’m thankful to the good

5016	God and Father of us all I’ve got you back, that’s long-suffering and

5017	merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness

5018	knows I’m unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings

5019	and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there’s few enough

5020	would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes.

5021	Go ’long Sid, Mary, Tom—take yourselves off—you’ve hendered me long

5022	enough.”

5023	

5024	The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper

5025	and vanquish her realism with Tom’s marvellous dream. Sid had better

5026	judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the

5027	house. It was this: “Pretty thin—as long a dream as that, without any

5028	mistakes in it!”

5029	

5030	What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,

5031	but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the

5032	public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see

5033	the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and

5034	drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud

5035	to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer

5036	at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into

5037	town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at

5038	all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have

5039	given anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his

5040	glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a

5041	circus.

5042	

5043	At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered

5044	such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were

5045	not long in becoming insufferably “stuck-up.” They began to tell their

5046	adventures to hungry listeners—but they only began; it was not a

5047	thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish

5048	material. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely

5049	puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.

5050	

5051	Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory

5052	was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,

5053	maybe she would be wanting to “make up.” Well, let her—she should see

5054	that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she

5055	arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group

5056	of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was

5057	tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,

5058	pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter

5059	when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her

5060	captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye

5061	in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity

5062	that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only “set him up”

5063	 the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he

5064	knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved

5065	irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and

5066	wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more

5067	particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang

5068	and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her

5069	feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to

5070	a girl almost at Tom’s elbow—with sham vivacity:

5071	

5072	“Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn’t you come to Sunday-school?”

5073	

5074	“I did come—didn’t you see me?”

5075	

5076	“Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?”

5077	

5078	“I was in Miss Peters’ class, where I always go. I saw _you_.”

5079	

5080	“Did you? Why, it’s funny I didn’t see you. I wanted to tell you about

5081	the picnic.”

5082	

5083	“Oh, that’s jolly. Who’s going to give it?”

5084	

5085	“My ma’s going to let me have one.”

5086	

5087	“Oh, goody; I hope she’ll let _me_ come.”

5088	

5089	“Well, she will. The picnic’s for me. She’ll let anybody come that I

5090	want, and I want you.”

5091	

5092	“That’s ever so nice. When is it going to be?”

5093	

5094	“By and by. Maybe about vacation.”

5095	

5096	“Oh, won’t it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?”

5097	

5098	“Yes, every one that’s friends to me—or wants to be”; and she glanced

5099	ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence

5100	about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the

5101	great sycamore tree “all to flinders” while he was “standing within

5102	three feet of it.”

5103	

5104	“Oh, may I come?” said Grace Miller.

5105	

5106	“Yes.”

5107	

5108	“And me?” said Sally Rogers.

5109	

5110	“Yes.”

5111	

5112	“And me, too?” said Susy Harper. “And Joe?”

5113	

5114	“Yes.”

5115	

5116	And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged

5117	for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still

5118	talking, and took Amy with him. Becky’s lips trembled and the tears

5119	came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on

5120	chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of

5121	everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and

5122	had what her sex call “a good cry.” Then she sat moody, with wounded

5123	pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast

5124	in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what

5125	_she’d_ do.

5126	

5127	At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant

5128	self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate

5129	her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden

5130	falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind

5131	the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple—and so

5132	absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,

5133	that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.

5134	Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom’s veins. He began to hate himself for

5135	throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He

5136	called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He

5137	wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,

5138	for her heart was singing, but Tom’s tongue had lost its function. He

5139	did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly

5140	he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced

5141	as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and

5142	again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could

5143	not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that

5144	Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the

5145	living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her

5146	fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.

5147	

5148	Amy’s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had

5149	to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in

5150	vain—the girl chirped on. Tom thought, “Oh, hang her, ain’t I ever going

5151	to get rid of her?” At last he must be attending to those things—and she

5152	said artlessly that she would be “around” when school let out. And he

5153	hastened away, hating her for it.

5154	

5155	“Any other boy!” Tom thought, grating his teeth. “Any boy in the whole

5156	town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is

5157	aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this

5158	town, mister, and I’ll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you

5159	out! I’ll just take and—”

5160	

5161	And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy—pummelling

5162	the air, and kicking and gouging. “Oh, you do, do you? You holler

5163	’nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!” And so the imaginary

5164	flogging was finished to his satisfaction.

5165	

5166	Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy’s

5167	grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other

5168	distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the

5169	minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to

5170	cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed,

5171	and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at

5172	a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew

5173	entirely miserable and wished she hadn’t carried it so far. When

5174	poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept

5175	exclaiming: “Oh, here’s a jolly one! look at this!” she lost patience at

5176	last, and said, “Oh, don’t bother me! I don’t care for them!” and burst

5177	into tears, and got up and walked away.

5178	

5179	Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she

5180	said:

5181	

5182	“Go away and leave me alone, can’t you! I hate you!”

5183	

5184	So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done—for she had said

5185	she would look at pictures all through the nooning—and she walked on,

5186	crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was

5187	humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth—the girl

5188	had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.

5189	He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.

5190	He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much

5191	risk to himself. Tom’s spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his

5192	opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and

5193	poured ink upon the page.

5194	

5195	Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,

5196	and moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,

5197	intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their

5198	troubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she

5199	had changed her mind. The thought of Tom’s treatment of her when she was

5200	talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.

5201	She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book’s

5202	account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.

5203	

5204	

5205	

5206	

5207	CHAPTER XIX

5208	

5209	

5210	TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said

5211	to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising

5212	market:

5213	

5214	“Tom, I’ve a notion to skin you alive!”

5215	

5216	“Auntie, what have I done?”

5217	

5218	“Well, you’ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old

5219	softy, expecting I’m going to make her believe all that rubbage about

5220	that dream, when lo and behold you she’d found out from Joe that you was

5221	over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don’t know

5222	what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so

5223	bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool

5224	of myself and never say a word.”

5225	

5226	This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had

5227	seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked

5228	mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to

5229	say for a moment. Then he said:

5230	

5231	“Auntie, I wish I hadn’t done it—but I didn’t think.”

5232	

5233	“Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your

5234	own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from

5235	Jackson’s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could

5236	think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn’t ever think

5237	to pity us and save us from sorrow.”

5238	

5239	“Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn’t mean to be mean. I didn’t,

5240	honest. And besides, I didn’t come over here to laugh at you that

5241	night.”

5242	

5243	“What did you come for, then?”

5244	

5245	“It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn’t got

5246	drownded.”

5247	

5248	“Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could

5249	believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never

5250	did—and I know it, Tom.”

5251	

5252	“Indeed and ’deed I did, auntie—I wish I may never stir if I didn’t.”

5253	

5254	“Oh, Tom, don’t lie—don’t do it. It only makes things a hundred times

5255	worse.”

5256	

5257	“It ain’t a lie, auntie; it’s the truth. I wanted to keep you from

5258	grieving—that was all that made me come.”

5259	

5260	“I’d give the whole world to believe that—it would cover up a power

5261	of sins, Tom. I’d ’most be glad you’d run off and acted so bad. But it

5262	ain’t reasonable; because, why didn’t you tell me, child?”

5263	

5264	“Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all

5265	full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn’t

5266	somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and

5267	kept mum.”

5268	

5269	“What bark?”

5270	

5271	“The bark I had wrote on to tell you we’d gone pirating. I wish, now,

5272	you’d waked up when I kissed you—I do, honest.”

5273	

5274	The hard lines in his aunt’s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned

5275	in her eyes.

5276	

5277	“_Did_ you kiss me, Tom?”

5278	

5279	“Why, yes, I did.”

5280	

5281	“Are you sure you did, Tom?”

5282	

5283	“Why, yes, I did, auntie—certain sure.”

5284	

5285	“What did you kiss me for, Tom?”

5286	

5287	“Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.”

5288	

5289	The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in

5290	her voice when she said:

5291	

5292	“Kiss me again, Tom!—and be off with you to school, now, and don’t

5293	bother me any more.”

5294	

5295	The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a

5296	jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her

5297	hand, and said to herself:

5298	

5299	“No, I don’t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he’s lied about it—but it’s a

5300	blessed, blessed lie, there’s such a comfort come from it. I hope

5301	the Lord—I _know_ the Lord will forgive him, because it was such

5302	good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don’t want to find out it’s a

5303	lie. I won’t look.”

5304	

5305	She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out

5306	her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more

5307	she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought:

5308	“It’s a good lie—it’s a good lie—I won’t let it grieve me.” So she

5309	sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom’s piece of

5310	bark through flowing tears and saying: “I could forgive the boy, now, if

5311	he’d committed a million sins!”

5312	

5313	

5314	

5315	

5316	CHAPTER XX

5317	

5318	

5319	THERE was something about Aunt Polly’s manner, when she kissed Tom, that

5320	swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He

5321	started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the

5322	head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a

5323	moment’s hesitation he ran to her and said:

5324	

5325	“I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I’m so sorry. I won’t ever, ever

5326	do that way again, as long as ever I live—please make up, won’t you?”

5327	

5328	The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:

5329	

5330	“I’ll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I’ll

5331	never speak to you again.”

5332	

5333	She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not

5334	even presence of mind enough to say “Who cares, Miss Smarty?” until the

5335	right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a

5336	fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were

5337	a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently

5338	encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled

5339	one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in

5340	her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to “take in,”

5341	 she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.

5342	If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom’s

5343	offensive fling had driven it entirely away.

5344	

5345	Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.

5346	The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied

5347	ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but

5348	poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village

5349	schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and

5350	absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept

5351	that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was

5352	perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy

5353	and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories

5354	were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.

5355	Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she

5356	noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She

5357	glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the

5358	book in her hands. The titlepage—Professor Somebody’s _Anatomy_—carried

5359	no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at

5360	once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece—a human figure,

5361	stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer

5362	stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky

5363	snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the

5364	pictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk,

5365	turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.

5366	

5367	“Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person

5368	and look at what they’re looking at.”

5369	

5370	“How could I know you was looking at anything?”

5371	

5372	“You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you’re

5373	going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I’ll be

5374	whipped, and I never was whipped in school.”

5375	

5376	Then she stamped her little foot and said:

5377	

5378	“_Be_ so mean if you want to! I know something that’s going to happen.

5379	You just wait and you’ll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!”—and she flung

5380	out of the house with a new explosion of crying.

5381	

5382	Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said

5383	to himself:

5384	

5385	“What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in

5386	school! Shucks! What’s a licking! That’s just like a girl—they’re so

5387	thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain’t going to tell

5388	old Dobbins on this little fool, because there’s other ways of getting

5389	even on her, that ain’t so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask

5390	who it was tore his book. Nobody’ll answer. Then he’ll do just the way

5391	he always does—ask first one and then t’other, and when he comes to the

5392	right girl he’ll know it, without any telling. Girls’ faces always tell

5393	on them. They ain’t got any backbone. She’ll get licked. Well, it’s a

5394	kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain’t any way

5395	out of it.” Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: “All

5396	right, though; she’d like to see me in just such a fix—let her sweat it

5397	out!”

5398	

5399	Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the

5400	master arrived and school “took in.” Tom did not feel a strong interest

5401	in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls’ side of the

5402	room Becky’s face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want

5403	to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get

5404	up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the

5405	spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom’s mind was entirely full

5406	of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her

5407	lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She

5408	did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he

5409	spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only

5410	seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad

5411	of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she

5412	was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse

5413	to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced

5414	herself to keep still—because, said she to herself, “he’ll tell about me

5415	tearing the picture sure. I wouldn’t say a word, not to save his life!”

5416	

5417	Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all

5418	broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly

5419	upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout—he

5420	had denied it for form’s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck

5421	to the denial from principle.

5422	

5423	A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air

5424	was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened

5425	himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,

5426	but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the

5427	pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched

5428	his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently

5429	for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!

5430	Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit

5431	look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot

5432	his quarrel with her. Quick—something must be done! done in a flash,

5433	too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.

5434	Good!—he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring

5435	through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little

5436	instant, and the chance was lost—the master opened the volume. If Tom

5437	only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help

5438	for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.

5439	Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even

5440	the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten—the

5441	master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: “Who tore this book?”

5442	

5443	There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness

5444	continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.

5445	

5446	“Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?”

5447	

5448	A denial. Another pause.

5449	

5450	“Joseph Harper, did you?”

5451	

5452	Another denial. Tom’s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the

5453	slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of

5454	boys—considered a while, then turned to the girls:

5455	

5456	“Amy Lawrence?”

5457	

5458	A shake of the head.

5459	

5460	“Gracie Miller?”

5461	

5462	The same sign.

5463	

5464	“Susan Harper, did you do this?”

5465	

5466	Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling

5467	from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the

5468	situation.

5469	

5470	“Rebecca Thatcher” [Tom glanced at her face—it was white with

5471	terror]—“did you tear—no, look me in the face” [her hands rose in

5472	appeal]—“did you tear this book?”

5473	

5474	A thought shot like lightning through Tom’s brain. He sprang to his feet

5475	and shouted—“I done it!”

5476	

5477	The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a

5478	moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward

5479	to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that

5480	shone upon him out of poor Becky’s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred

5481	floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without

5482	an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever

5483	administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a

5484	command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed—for he

5485	knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not

5486	count the tedious time as loss, either.

5487	

5488	Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for

5489	with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own

5490	treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to

5491	pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky’s latest words

5492	lingering dreamily in his ear—

5493	

5494	“Tom, how _could_ you be so noble!”

5495	

5496	

5497	

5498	

5499	CHAPTER XXI

5500	

5501	

5502	VACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer

5503	and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good

5504	showing on “Examination” day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle

5505	now—at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young

5506	ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins’ lashings

5507	were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a

5508	perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there

5509	was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached,

5510	all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a

5511	vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence

5512	was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and

5513	their nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do

5514	the master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution

5515	that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that

5516	the boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they

5517	conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.

5518	They swore in the signpainter’s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his

5519	help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded

5520	in his father’s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.

5521	The master’s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and

5522	there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always

5523	prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and

5524	the signpainter’s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper

5525	condition on Examination Evening he would “manage the thing” while he

5526	napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time

5527	and hurried away to school.

5528	

5529	In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in

5530	the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with

5531	wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in

5532	his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.

5533	He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and

5534	six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town

5535	and by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of

5536	citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the

5537	scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of

5538	small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;

5539	rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in

5540	lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their

5541	grandmothers’ ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and

5542	the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with

5543	non-participating scholars.

5544	

5545	The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,

5546	“You’d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,”

5547	 etc.—accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic

5548	gestures which a machine might have used—supposing the machine to be a

5549	trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared,

5550	and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and

5551	retired.

5552	

5553	A little shamefaced girl lisped, “Mary had a little lamb,” etc.,

5554	performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and

5555	sat down flushed and happy.

5556	

5557	Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into

5558	the unquenchable and indestructible “Give me liberty or give me death”

5559	 speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the

5560	middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under

5561	him and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the

5562	house but he had the house’s silence, too, which was even worse than

5563	its sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom

5564	struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak

5565	attempt at applause, but it died early.

5566	

5567	“The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck” followed; also “The Assyrian Came

5568	Down,” and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,

5569	and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The

5570	prime feature of the evening was in order, now—original “compositions”

5571	 by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the

5572	platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty

5573	ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to “expression”

5574	 and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon

5575	similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers,

5576	and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the

5577	Crusades. “Friendship” was one; “Memories of Other Days”; “Religion in

5578	History”; “Dream Land”; “The Advantages of Culture”; “Forms of Political

5579	Government Compared and Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial Love”; “Heart

5580	Longings,” etc., etc.

5581	

5582	A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted

5583	melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of “fine language”;

5584	another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words

5585	and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that

5586	conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable

5587	sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one

5588	of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was

5589	made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious

5590	mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of

5591	these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the

5592	fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will

5593	be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in

5594	all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their

5595	compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the

5596	most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always

5597	the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely

5598	truth is unpalatable.

5599	

5600	Let us return to the “Examination.” The first composition that was read

5601	was one entitled “Is this, then, Life?” Perhaps the reader can endure an

5602	extract from it:

5603	

5604	“In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the

5605	youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity!

5606	Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the

5607	voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, ‘the

5608	observed of all observers.’ Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes,

5609	is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest,

5610	her step is lightest in the gay assembly.

5611	

5612	“In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour

5613	arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has

5614	had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her

5615	enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But

5616	after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is

5617	vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly

5618	upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health

5619	and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly

5620	pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!”

5621	

5622	And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to

5623	time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “How

5624	sweet!” “How eloquent!” “So true!” etc., and after the thing had closed

5625	with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.

5626	

5627	Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the “interesting”

5628	 paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a “poem.” Two

5629	stanzas of it will do:

5630	

5631	“A MISSOURI MAIDEN’S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA

5632	

5633	“Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well! But yet for a while do I leave thee

5634	now! Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell, And burning

5635	recollections throng my brow! For I have wandered through thy flowery

5636	woods; Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa’s stream; Have listened to

5637	Tallassee’s warring floods, And wooed on Coosa’s side Aurora’s beam.

5638	

5639	“Yet shame I not to bear an o’erfull heart, Nor blush to turn behind

5640	my tearful eyes; ’Tis from no stranger land I now must part, ’Tis to no

5641	strangers left I yield these sighs. Welcome and home were mine within

5642	this State, Whose vales I leave—whose spires fade fast from me And cold

5643	must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete, When, dear Alabama! they turn

5644	cold on thee!” There were very few there who knew what “tete” meant, but

5645	the poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.

5646	

5647	Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady,

5648	who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began

5649	to read in a measured, solemn tone:

5650	

5651	“A VISION

5652	

5653	“Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single

5654	star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly

5655	vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry

5656	mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power

5657	exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous

5658	winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered

5659	about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.

5660	

5661	“At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit

5662	sighed; but instead thereof,

5663	

5664	“‘My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide—My joy in

5665	grief, my second bliss in joy,’ came to my side. She moved like one of

5666	those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy’s Eden by

5667	the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own

5668	transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it failed to make even a

5669	sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch,

5670	as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away

5671	unperceived—unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like

5672	icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending

5673	elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.”

5674	

5675	This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a

5676	sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took

5677	the first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest

5678	effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize

5679	to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by

5680	far the most “eloquent” thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel

5681	Webster himself might well be proud of it.

5682	

5683	It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which

5684	the word “beauteous” was over-fondled, and human experience referred to

5685	as “life’s page,” was up to the usual average.

5686	

5687	Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair

5688	aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of

5689	America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he

5690	made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter

5691	rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to

5692	right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted

5693	them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his

5694	entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down

5695	by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined

5696	he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly

5697	increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with

5698	a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat,

5699	suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about

5700	her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she

5701	curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed

5702	at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher—the cat was

5703	within six inches of the absorbed teacher’s head—down, down, a little

5704	lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it,

5705	and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still

5706	in her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master’s

5707	bald pate—for the signpainter’s boy had _gilded_ it!

5708	

5709	That broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.

5710	

5711	NOTE:—The pretended “compositions” quoted in this chapter are taken

5712	without alteration from a volume entitled “Prose and Poetry, by a

5713	Western Lady”—but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl

5714	pattern, and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be.

5715	

5716	

5717	

5718	

5719	CHAPTER XXII

5720	

5721	

5722	TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the

5723	showy character of their “regalia.” He promised to abstain from smoking,

5724	chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out

5725	a new thing—namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way

5726	in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon

5727	found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire

5728	grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display

5729	himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth

5730	of July was coming; but he soon gave that up—gave it up before he had

5731	worn his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon old

5732	Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed

5733	and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.

5734	During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge’s condition

5735	and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high—so high that

5736	he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the

5737	looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.

5738	At last he was pronounced upon the mend—and then convalescent. Tom was

5739	disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation

5740	at once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom

5741	resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.

5742	

5743	The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated

5744	to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again,

5745	however—there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now—but

5746	found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he

5747	could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.

5748	

5749	Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning

5750	to hang a little heavily on his hands.

5751	

5752	He attempted a diary—but nothing happened during three days, and so he

5753	abandoned it.

5754	

5755	The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a

5756	sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy

5757	for two days.

5758	

5759	Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained

5760	hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man

5761	in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States

5762	Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment—for he was not

5763	twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.

5764	

5765	A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents

5766	made of rag carpeting—admission, three pins for boys, two for girls—and

5767	then circusing was abandoned.

5768	

5769	A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came—and went again and left the village

5770	duller and drearier than ever.

5771	

5772	There were some boys-and-girls’ parties, but they were so few and so

5773	delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.

5774	

5775	Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her

5776	parents during vacation—so there was no bright side to life anywhere.

5777	

5778	The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very

5779	cancer for permanency and pain.

5780	

5781	Then came the measles.

5782	

5783	During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its

5784	happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got

5785	upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had

5786	come over everything and every creature. There had been a “revival,” and

5787	everybody had “got religion,” not only the adults, but even the boys and

5788	girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed

5789	sinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe

5790	Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing

5791	spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a

5792	basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to

5793	the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy

5794	he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in

5795	desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn

5796	and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he

5797	crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,

5798	forever and forever.

5799	

5800	And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful

5801	claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head

5802	with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for

5803	he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him.

5804	He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the

5805	extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have

5806	seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a

5807	battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the

5808	getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from

5809	under an insect like himself.

5810	

5811	By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its

5812	object. The boy’s first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His

5813	second was to wait—for there might not be any more storms.

5814	

5815	The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he

5816	spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad

5817	at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how

5818	lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted

5819	listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a

5820	juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her

5821	victim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a

5822	stolen melon. Poor lads! they—like Tom—had suffered a relapse.

5823	

5824	

5825	

5826	

5827	CHAPTER XXIII

5828	

5829	

5830	AT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred—and vigorously: the murder

5831	trial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village

5832	talk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to

5833	the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience

5834	and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in

5835	his hearing as “feelers”; he did not see how he could be suspected of

5836	knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable

5837	in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.

5838	He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some

5839	relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of

5840	distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself

5841	that Huck had remained discreet.

5842	

5843	“Huck, have you ever told anybody about—that?”

5844	

5845	“’Bout what?”

5846	

5847	“You know what.”

5848	

5849	“Oh—’course I haven’t.”

5850	

5851	“Never a word?”

5852	

5853	“Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?”

5854	

5855	“Well, I was afeard.”

5856	

5857	“Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn’t be alive two days if that got found out.

5858	_You_ know that.”

5859	

5860	Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:

5861	

5862	“Huck, they couldn’t anybody get you to tell, could they?”

5863	

5864	“Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they

5865	could get me to tell. They ain’t no different way.”

5866	

5867	“Well, that’s all right, then. I reckon we’re safe as long as we keep

5868	mum. But let’s swear again, anyway. It’s more surer.”

5869	

5870	“I’m agreed.”

5871	

5872	So they swore again with dread solemnities.

5873	

5874	“What is the talk around, Huck? I’ve heard a power of it.”

5875	

5876	“Talk? Well, it’s just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the

5877	time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so’s I want to hide som’ers.”

5878	

5879	“That’s just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he’s a goner.

5880	Don’t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?”

5881	

5882	“Most always—most always. He ain’t no account; but then he hain’t ever

5883	done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to

5884	get drunk on—and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do

5885	that—leastways most of us—preachers and such like. But he’s kind of

5886	good—he give me half a fish, once, when there warn’t enough for two; and

5887	lots of times he’s kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.”

5888	

5889	“Well, he’s mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line.

5890	I wish we could get him out of there.”

5891	

5892	“My! we couldn’t get him out, Tom. And besides, ’twouldn’t do any good;

5893	they’d ketch him again.”

5894	

5895	“Yes—so they would. But I hate to hear ’em abuse him so like the dickens

5896	when he never done—that.”

5897	

5898	“I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear ’em say he’s the bloodiest looking villain

5899	in this country, and they wonder he wasn’t ever hung before.”

5900	

5901	“Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I’ve heard ’em say that if he

5902	was to get free they’d lynch him.”

5903	

5904	“And they’d do it, too.”

5905	

5906	The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the

5907	twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood

5908	of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that

5909	something would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But

5910	nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in

5911	this luckless captive.

5912	

5913	The boys did as they had often done before—went to the cell grating and

5914	gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and

5915	there were no guards.

5916	

5917	His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences

5918	before—it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and

5919	treacherous to the last degree when Potter said:

5920	

5921	“You’ve been mighty good to me, boys—better’n anybody else in this town.

5922	And I don’t forget it, I don’t. Often I says to myself, says I, ‘I used

5923	to mend all the boys’ kites and things, and show ’em where the good

5924	fishin’ places was, and befriend ’em what I could, and now they’ve

5925	all forgot old Muff when he’s in trouble; but Tom don’t, and Huck

5926	don’t—_they_ don’t forget him, says I, ‘and I don’t forget them.’ Well,

5927	boys, I done an awful thing—drunk and crazy at the time—that’s the only

5928	way I account for it—and now I got to swing for it, and it’s right.

5929	Right, and _best_, too, I reckon—hope so, anyway. Well, we won’t talk

5930	about that. I don’t want to make _you_ feel bad; you’ve befriended me.

5931	But what I want to say, is, don’t _you_ ever get drunk—then you won’t

5932	ever get here. Stand a litter furder west—so—that’s it; it’s a prime

5933	comfort to see faces that’s friendly when a body’s in such a muck

5934	of trouble, and there don’t none come here but yourn. Good friendly

5935	faces—good friendly faces. Git up on one another’s backs and let me

5936	touch ’em. That’s it. Shake hands—yourn’ll come through the bars, but

5937	mine’s too big. Little hands, and weak—but they’ve helped Muff Potter a

5938	power, and they’d help him more if they could.”

5939	

5940	Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.

5941	The next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an

5942	almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.

5943	Huck was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other.

5944	Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination

5945	always brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers

5946	sauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing

5947	news—the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor

5948	Potter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect

5949	that Injun Joe’s evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was

5950	not the slightest question as to what the jury’s verdict would be.

5951	

5952	Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He

5953	was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to

5954	sleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for

5955	this was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented

5956	in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took

5957	their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and

5958	hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all

5959	the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,

5960	stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and

5961	the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings

5962	among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These

5963	details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation

5964	that was as impressive as it was fascinating.

5965	

5966	Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing

5967	in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was

5968	discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further

5969	questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:

5970	

5971	“Take the witness.”

5972	

5973	The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when

5974	his own counsel said:

5975	

5976	“I have no questions to ask him.”

5977	

5978	The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.

5979	Counsel for the prosecution said:

5980	

5981	“Take the witness.”

5982	

5983	“I have no questions to ask him,” Potter’s lawyer replied.

5984	

5985	A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter’s

5986	possession.

5987	

5988	“Take the witness.”

5989	

5990	Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience

5991	began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his

5992	client’s life without an effort?

5993	

5994	Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter’s guilty behavior when

5995	brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand

5996	without being cross-questioned.

5997	

5998	Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the

5999	graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was

6000	brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined

6001	by Potter’s lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house

6002	expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.

6003	Counsel for the prosecution now said:

6004	

6005	“By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have

6006	fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the

6007	unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.”

6008	

6009	A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and

6010	rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned

6011	in the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many women’s compassion

6012	testified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:

6013	

6014	“Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we

6015	foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed

6016	while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced

6017	by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.” [Then

6018	to the clerk:] “Call Thomas Sawyer!”

6019	

6020	A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting

6021	Potter’s. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as

6022	he rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough,

6023	for he was badly scared. The oath was administered.

6024	

6025	“Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the

6026	hour of midnight?”

6027	

6028	Tom glanced at Injun Joe’s iron face and his tongue failed him. The

6029	audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few

6030	moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed

6031	to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:

6032	

6033	“In the graveyard!”

6034	

6035	“A little bit louder, please. Don’t be afraid. You were—”

6036	

6037	“In the graveyard.”

6038	

6039	A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe’s face.

6040	

6041	“Were you anywhere near Horse Williams’ grave?”

6042	

6043	“Yes, sir.”

6044	

6045	“Speak up—just a trifle louder. How near were you?”

6046	

6047	“Near as I am to you.”

6048	

6049	“Were you hidden, or not?”

6050	

6051	“I was hid.”

6052	

6053	“Where?”

6054	

6055	“Behind the elms that’s on the edge of the grave.”

6056	

6057	Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.

6058	

6059	“Any one with you?”

6060	

6061	“Yes, sir. I went there with—”

6062	

6063	“Wait—wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion’s name. We

6064	will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with

6065	you.”

6066	

6067	Tom hesitated and looked confused.

6068	

6069	“Speak out, my boy—don’t be diffident. The truth is always respectable.

6070	What did you take there?”

6071	

6072	“Only a—a—dead cat.”

6073	

6074	There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.

6075	

6076	“We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us

6077	everything that occurred—tell it in your own way—don’t skip anything,

6078	and don’t be afraid.”

6079	

6080	Tom began—hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his

6081	words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased

6082	but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and

6083	bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,

6084	rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent

6085	emotion reached its climax when the boy said:

6086	

6087	“—and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun

6088	Joe jumped with the knife and—”

6089	

6090	Crash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his

6091	way through all opposers, and was gone!

6092	

6093	

6094	

6095	

6096	CHAPTER XXIV

6097	

6098	

6099	TOM was a glittering hero once more—the pet of the old, the envy of the

6100	young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper

6101	magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet,

6102	if he escaped hanging.

6103	

6104	As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom

6105	and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort

6106	of conduct is to the world’s credit; therefore it is not well to find

6107	fault with it.

6108	

6109	Tom’s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights

6110	were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always

6111	with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy

6112	to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of

6113	wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer

6114	the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid

6115	that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding

6116	Injun Joe’s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.

6117	The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of

6118	that? Since Tom’s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the

6119	lawyer’s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had

6120	been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck’s

6121	confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.

6122	

6123	Daily Muff Potter’s gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly

6124	he wished he had sealed up his tongue.

6125	

6126	Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the

6127	other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a

6128	safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.

6129	

6130	Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun

6131	Joe was found. One of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels, a

6132	detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked

6133	wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that

6134	craft usually achieve. That is to say, he “found a clew.” But you can’t

6135	hang a “clew” for murder, and so after that detective had got through

6136	and gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.

6137	

6138	The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened

6139	weight of apprehension.

6140	

6141	

6142	

6143	

6144	CHAPTER XXV

6145	

6146	

6147	THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy’s life when he has

6148	a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire

6149	suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe Harper,

6150	but failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing.

6151	Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would

6152	answer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him

6153	confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand

6154	in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,

6155	for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is

6156	not money. “Where’ll we dig?” said Huck.

6157	

6158	“Oh, most anywhere.”

6159	

6160	“Why, is it hid all around?”

6161	

6162	“No, indeed it ain’t. It’s hid in mighty particular places,

6163	Huck—sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of

6164	a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but

6165	mostly under the floor in ha’nted houses.”

6166	

6167	“Who hides it?”

6168	

6169	“Why, robbers, of course—who’d you reckon? Sunday-school

6170	sup’rintendents?”

6171	

6172	“I don’t know. If ’twas mine I wouldn’t hide it; I’d spend it and have a

6173	good time.”

6174	

6175	“So would I. But robbers don’t do that way. They always hide it and

6176	leave it there.”

6177	

6178	“Don’t they come after it any more?”

6179	

6180	“No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else

6181	they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and

6182	by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks—a

6183	paper that’s got to be ciphered over about a week because it’s mostly

6184	signs and hy’roglyphics.”

6185	

6186	“Hyro—which?”

6187	

6188	“Hy’roglyphics—pictures and things, you know, that don’t seem to mean

6189	anything.”

6190	

6191	“Have you got one of them papers, Tom?”

6192	

6193	“No.”

6194	

6195	“Well then, how you going to find the marks?”

6196	

6197	“I don’t want any marks. They always bury it under a ha’nted house or on

6198	an island, or under a dead tree that’s got one limb sticking out. Well,

6199	we’ve tried Jackson’s Island a little, and we can try it again some

6200	time; and there’s the old ha’nted house up the Still-House branch, and

6201	there’s lots of dead-limb trees—dead loads of ’em.”

6202	

6203	“Is it under all of them?”

6204	

6205	“How you talk! No!”

6206	

6207	“Then how you going to know which one to go for?”

6208	

6209	“Go for all of ’em!”

6210	

6211	“Why, Tom, it’ll take all summer.”

6212	

6213	“Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars

6214	in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di’monds. How’s

6215	that?”

6216	

6217	Huck’s eyes glowed.

6218	

6219	“That’s bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred

6220	dollars and I don’t want no di’monds.”

6221	

6222	“All right. But I bet you I ain’t going to throw off on di’monds. Some

6223	of ’em’s worth twenty dollars apiece—there ain’t any, hardly, but’s

6224	worth six bits or a dollar.”

6225	

6226	“No! Is that so?”

6227	

6228	“Cert’nly—anybody’ll tell you so. Hain’t you ever seen one, Huck?”

6229	

6230	“Not as I remember.”

6231	

6232	“Oh, kings have slathers of them.”

6233	

6234	“Well, I don’ know no kings, Tom.”

6235	

6236	“I reckon you don’t. But if you was to go to Europe you’d see a raft of

6237	’em hopping around.”

6238	

6239	“Do they hop?”

6240	

6241	“Hop?—your granny! No!”

6242	

6243	“Well, what did you say they did, for?”

6244	

6245	“Shucks, I only meant you’d _see_ ’em—not hopping, of course—what do

6246	they want to hop for?—but I mean you’d just see ’em—scattered around,

6247	you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.”

6248	

6249	“Richard? What’s his other name?”

6250	

6251	“He didn’t have any other name. Kings don’t have any but a given name.”

6252	

6253	“No?”

6254	

6255	“But they don’t.”

6256	

6257	“Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don’t want to be a king

6258	and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say—where you going

6259	to dig first?”

6260	

6261	“Well, I don’t know. S’pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the

6262	hill t’other side of Still-House branch?”

6263	

6264	“I’m agreed.”

6265	

6266	So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their

6267	three-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves

6268	down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.

6269	

6270	“I like this,” said Tom.

6271	

6272	“So do I.”

6273	

6274	“Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your

6275	share?”

6276	

6277	“Well, I’ll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I’ll go to every

6278	circus that comes along. I bet I’ll have a gay time.”

6279	

6280	“Well, ain’t you going to save any of it?”

6281	

6282	“Save it? What for?”

6283	

6284	“Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.”

6285	

6286	“Oh, that ain’t any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day

6287	and get his claws on it if I didn’t hurry up, and I tell you he’d clean

6288	it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?”

6289	

6290	“I’m going to buy a new drum, and a sure’nough sword, and a red necktie

6291	and a bull pup, and get married.”

6292	

6293	“Married!”

6294	

6295	“That’s it.”

6296	

6297	“Tom, you—why, you ain’t in your right mind.”

6298	

6299	“Wait—you’ll see.”

6300	

6301	“Well, that’s the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my

6302	mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty

6303	well.”

6304	

6305	“That ain’t anything. The girl I’m going to marry won’t fight.”

6306	

6307	“Tom, I reckon they’re all alike. They’ll all comb a body. Now you

6308	better think ’bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What’s the name

6309	of the gal?”

6310	

6311	“It ain’t a gal at all—it’s a girl.”

6312	

6313	“It’s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl—both’s

6314	right, like enough. Anyway, what’s her name, Tom?”

6315	

6316	“I’ll tell you some time—not now.”

6317	

6318	“All right—that’ll do. Only if you get married I’ll be more lonesomer

6319	than ever.”

6320	

6321	“No you won’t. You’ll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and

6322	we’ll go to digging.”

6323	

6324	They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another

6325	halfhour. Still no result. Huck said:

6326	

6327	“Do they always bury it as deep as this?”

6328	

6329	“Sometimes—not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven’t got the right

6330	place.”

6331	

6332	So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little,

6333	but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time.

6334	Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his

6335	brow with his sleeve, and said:

6336	

6337	“Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?”

6338	

6339	“I reckon maybe we’ll tackle the old tree that’s over yonder on Cardiff

6340	Hill back of the widow’s.”

6341	

6342	“I reckon that’ll be a good one. But won’t the widow take it away from

6343	us, Tom? It’s on her land.”

6344	

6345	“_She_ take it away! Maybe she’d like to try it once. Whoever finds one

6346	of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don’t make any difference

6347	whose land it’s on.”

6348	

6349	That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:

6350	

6351	“Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?”

6352	

6353	“It is mighty curious, Huck. I don’t understand it. Sometimes witches

6354	interfere. I reckon maybe that’s what’s the trouble now.”

6355	

6356	“Shucks! Witches ain’t got no power in the daytime.”

6357	

6358	“Well, that’s so. I didn’t think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is!

6359	What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow

6360	of the limb falls at midnight, and that’s where you dig!”

6361	

6362	“Then consound it, we’ve fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang

6363	it all, we got to come back in the night. It’s an awful long way. Can

6364	you get out?”

6365	

6366	“I bet I will. We’ve got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees

6367	these holes they’ll know in a minute what’s here and they’ll go for it.”

6368	

6369	“Well, I’ll come around and maow tonight.”

6370	

6371	“All right. Let’s hide the tools in the bushes.”

6372	

6373	The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in

6374	the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by

6375	old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked

6376	in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the

6377	distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were

6378	subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged

6379	that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to

6380	dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and

6381	their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,

6382	but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon

6383	something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone

6384	or a chunk. At last Tom said:

6385	

6386	“It ain’t any use, Huck, we’re wrong again.”

6387	

6388	“Well, but we _can’t_ be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.”

6389	

6390	“I know it, but then there’s another thing.”

6391	

6392	“What’s that?”.

6393	

6394	“Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too

6395	early.”

6396	

6397	Huck dropped his shovel.

6398	

6399	“That’s it,” said he. “That’s the very trouble. We got to give this one

6400	up. We can’t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing’s

6401	too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering

6402	around so. I feel as if something’s behind me all the time; and I’m

6403	afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there’s others in front a-waiting for

6404	a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.”

6405	

6406	“Well, I’ve been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a

6407	dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.”

6408	

6409	“Lordy!”

6410	

6411	“Yes, they do. I’ve always heard that.”

6412	

6413	“Tom, I don’t like to fool around much where there’s dead people. A

6414	body’s bound to get into trouble with ’em, sure.”

6415	

6416	“I don’t like to stir ’em up, either. S’pose this one here was to stick

6417	his skull out and say something!”

6418	

6419	“Don’t Tom! It’s awful.”

6420	

6421	“Well, it just is. Huck, I don’t feel comfortable a bit.”

6422	

6423	“Say, Tom, let’s give this place up, and try somewheres else.”

6424	

6425	“All right, I reckon we better.”

6426	

6427	“What’ll it be?”

6428	

6429	Tom considered awhile; and then said:

6430	

6431	“The ha’nted house. That’s it!”

6432	

6433	“Blame it, I don’t like ha’nted houses, Tom. Why, they’re a dern sight

6434	worse’n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don’t come

6435	sliding around in a shroud, when you ain’t noticing, and peep over your

6436	shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I

6437	couldn’t stand such a thing as that, Tom—nobody could.”

6438	

6439	“Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don’t travel around only at night. They won’t

6440	hender us from digging there in the daytime.”

6441	

6442	“Well, that’s so. But you know mighty well people don’t go about that

6443	ha’nted house in the day nor the night.”

6444	

6445	“Well, that’s mostly because they don’t like to go where a man’s been

6446	murdered, anyway—but nothing’s ever been seen around that house except

6447	in the night—just some blue lights slipping by the windows—no regular

6448	ghosts.”

6449	

6450	“Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom,

6451	you can bet there’s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason.

6452	Becuz you know that they don’t anybody but ghosts use ’em.”

6453	

6454	“Yes, that’s so. But anyway they don’t come around in the daytime, so

6455	what’s the use of our being afeard?”

6456	

6457	“Well, all right. We’ll tackle the ha’nted house if you say so—but I

6458	reckon it’s taking chances.”

6459	

6460	They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the

6461	moonlit valley below them stood the “ha’nted” house, utterly isolated,

6462	its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the

6463	chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof

6464	caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit

6465	past a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the

6466	circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted

6467	house a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that

6468	adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.

6469	

6470	

6471	

6472	

6473	CHAPTER XXVI

6474	

6475	

6476	ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come

6477	for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was

6478	measurably so, also—but suddenly said:

6479	

6480	“Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?”

6481	

6482	Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his

6483	eyes with a startled look in them—

6484	

6485	“My! I never once thought of it, Huck!”

6486	

6487	“Well, I didn’t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was

6488	Friday.”

6489	

6490	“Blame it, a body can’t be too careful, Huck. We might ’a’ got into an

6491	awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.”

6492	

6493	“_Might_! Better say we _would_! There’s some lucky days, maybe, but

6494	Friday ain’t.”

6495	

6496	“Any fool knows that. I don’t reckon _you_ was the first that found it

6497	out, Huck.”

6498	

6499	“Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain’t all, neither. I had a

6500	rotten bad dream last night—dreampt about rats.”

6501	

6502	“No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?”

6503	

6504	“No.”

6505	

6506	“Well, that’s good, Huck. When they don’t fight it’s only a sign that

6507	there’s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty

6508	sharp and keep out of it. We’ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do

6509	you know Robin Hood, Huck?”

6510	

6511	“No. Who’s Robin Hood?”

6512	

6513	“Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England—and the

6514	best. He was a robber.”

6515	

6516	“Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?”

6517	

6518	“Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But

6519	he never bothered the poor. He loved ’em. He always divided up with ’em

6520	perfectly square.”

6521	

6522	“Well, he must ’a’ been a brick.”

6523	

6524	“I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.

6525	They ain’t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in

6526	England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow

6527	and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.”

6528	

6529	“What’s a _yew_ bow?”

6530	

6531	“I don’t know. It’s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that

6532	dime only on the edge he would set down and cry—and curse. But we’ll

6533	play Robin Hood—it’s nobby fun. I’ll learn you.”

6534	

6535	“I’m agreed.”

6536	

6537	So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a

6538	yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the

6539	morrow’s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink

6540	into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows

6541	of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff

6542	Hill.

6543	

6544	On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.

6545	They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their

6546	last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were

6547	so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down

6548	within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and

6549	turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this

6550	time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling

6551	that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the

6552	requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.

6553	

6554	When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and

6555	grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,

6556	and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the

6557	place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they

6558	crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown,

6559	floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows,

6560	a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and

6561	abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened

6562	pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,

6563	and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.

6564	

6565	In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the

6566	place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own

6567	boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs.

6568	This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring

6569	each other, and of course there could be but one result—they threw their

6570	tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of

6571	decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the

6572	promise was a fraud—there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now

6573	and well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when—

6574	

6575	“Sh!” said Tom.

6576	

6577	“What is it?” whispered Huck, blanching with fright.

6578	

6579	“Sh!... There!... Hear it?”

6580	

6581	“Yes!... Oh, my! Let’s run!”

6582	

6583	“Keep still! Don’t you budge! They’re coming right toward the door.”

6584	

6585	The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to

6586	knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.

6587	

6588	“They’ve stopped.... No—coming.... Here they are. Don’t whisper another

6589	word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!”

6590	

6591	Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: “There’s the old deaf and

6592	dumb Spaniard that’s been about town once or twice lately—never saw

6593	t’other man before.”

6594	

6595	“T’other” was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant

6596	in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white

6597	whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore

6598	green goggles. When they came in, “t’other” was talking in a low voice;

6599	they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the

6600	wall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less

6601	guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:

6602	

6603	“No,” said he, “I’ve thought it all over, and I don’t like it. It’s

6604	dangerous.”

6605	

6606	“Dangerous!” grunted the “deaf and dumb” Spaniard—to the vast surprise

6607	of the boys. “Milksop!”

6608	

6609	This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe’s! There was

6610	silence for some time. Then Joe said:

6611	

6612	“What’s any more dangerous than that job up yonder—but nothing’s come of

6613	it.”

6614	

6615	“That’s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.

6616	’Twon’t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn’t succeed.”

6617	

6618	“Well, what’s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!—anybody

6619	would suspicion us that saw us.”

6620	

6621	“I know that. But there warn’t any other place as handy after that fool

6622	of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it

6623	warn’t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys

6624	playing over there on the hill right in full view.”

6625	

6626	“Those infernal boys” quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,

6627	and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and

6628	concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a

6629	year.

6630	

6631	The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and

6632	thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:

6633	

6634	“Look here, lad—you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there

6635	till you hear from me. I’ll take the chances on dropping into this town

6636	just once more, for a look. We’ll do that ‘dangerous’ job after I’ve

6637	spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas!

6638	We’ll leg it together!”

6639	

6640	This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe

6641	said:

6642	

6643	“I’m dead for sleep! It’s your turn to watch.”

6644	

6645	He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred

6646	him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to

6647	nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.

6648	

6649	The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:

6650	

6651	“Now’s our chance—come!”

6652	

6653	Huck said:

6654	

6655	“I can’t—I’d die if they was to wake.”

6656	

6657	Tom urged—Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and

6658	started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak

6659	from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never

6660	made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments

6661	till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray;

6662	and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.

6663	

6664	Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around—smiled grimly upon

6665	his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees—stirred him up with

6666	his foot and said:

6667	

6668	“Here! _You’re_ a watchman, ain’t you! All right, though—nothing’s

6669	happened.”

6670	

6671	“My! have I been asleep?”

6672	

6673	“Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What’ll we

6674	do with what little swag we’ve got left?”

6675	

6676	“I don’t know—leave it here as we’ve always done, I reckon. No use to

6677	take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver’s

6678	something to carry.”

6679	

6680	“Well—all right—it won’t matter to come here once more.”

6681	

6682	“No—but I’d say come in the night as we used to do—it’s better.”

6683	

6684	“Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right

6685	chance at that job; accidents might happen; ’tain’t in such a very good

6686	place; we’ll just regularly bury it—and bury it deep.”

6687	

6688	“Good idea,” said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,

6689	raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled

6690	pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself

6691	and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on

6692	his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.

6693	

6694	The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With

6695	gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!—the splendor of it was

6696	beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make

6697	half a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest

6698	auspices—there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to

6699	dig. They nudged each other every moment—eloquent nudges and easily

6700	understood, for they simply meant—“Oh, but ain’t you glad _now_ we’re

6701	here!”

6702	

6703	Joe’s knife struck upon something.

6704	

6705	“Hello!” said he.

6706	

6707	“What is it?” said his comrade.

6708	

6709	“Half-rotten plank—no, it’s a box, I believe. Here—bear a hand and we’ll

6710	see what it’s here for. Never mind, I’ve broke a hole.”

6711	

6712	He reached his hand in and drew it out—

6713	

6714	“Man, it’s money!”

6715	

6716	The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys

6717	above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.

6718	

6719	Joe’s comrade said:

6720	

6721	“We’ll make quick work of this. There’s an old rusty pick over amongst

6722	the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace—I saw it a

6723	minute ago.”

6724	

6725	He ran and brought the boys’ pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the

6726	pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to

6727	himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was

6728	not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the

6729	slow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in

6730	blissful silence.

6731	

6732	“Pard, there’s thousands of dollars here,” said Injun Joe.

6733	

6734	“’Twas always said that Murrel’s gang used to be around here one

6735	summer,” the stranger observed.

6736	

6737	“I know it,” said Injun Joe; “and this looks like it, I should say.”

6738	

6739	“Now you won’t need to do that job.”

6740	

6741	The halfbreed frowned. Said he:

6742	

6743	“You don’t know me. Least you don’t know all about that thing. ’Tain’t

6744	robbery altogether—it’s _revenge_!” and a wicked light flamed in his

6745	eyes. “I’ll need your help in it. When it’s finished—then Texas. Go home

6746	to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.”

6747	

6748	“Well—if you say so; what’ll we do with this—bury it again?”

6749	

6750	“Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] _No_! by the great Sachem, no!

6751	[Profound distress overhead.] I’d nearly forgot. That pick had fresh

6752	earth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business

6753	has a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on

6754	them? Who brought them here—and where are they gone? Have you heard

6755	anybody?—seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and

6756	see the ground disturbed? Not exactly—not exactly. We’ll take it to my

6757	den.”

6758	

6759	“Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number

6760	One?”

6761	

6762	“No—Number Two—under the cross. The other place is bad—too common.”

6763	

6764	“All right. It’s nearly dark enough to start.”

6765	

6766	Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping

6767	out. Presently he said:

6768	

6769	“Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be

6770	upstairs?”

6771	

6772	The boys’ breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,

6773	halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The

6774	boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came

6775	creaking up the stairs—the intolerable distress of the situation woke

6776	the stricken resolution of the lads—they were about to spring for the

6777	closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on

6778	the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself

6779	up cursing, and his comrade said:

6780	

6781	“Now what’s the use of all that? If it’s anybody, and they’re up there,

6782	let them _stay_ there—who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get

6783	into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes—and then

6784	let them follow us if they want to. I’m willing. In my opinion, whoever

6785	hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or

6786	devils or something. I’ll bet they’re running yet.”

6787	

6788	Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight

6789	was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.

6790	Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening

6791	twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.

6792	

6793	Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them

6794	through the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They

6795	were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the

6796	townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much

6797	absorbed in hating themselves—hating the ill luck that made them take

6798	the spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have

6799	suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait

6800	there till his “revenge” was satisfied, and then he would have had the

6801	misfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that

6802	the tools were ever brought there!

6803	

6804	They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to

6805	town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to

6806	“Number Two,” wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to

6807	Tom.

6808	

6809	“Revenge? What if he means _us_, Huck!”

6810	

6811	“Oh, don’t!” said Huck, nearly fainting.

6812	

6813	They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe

6814	that he might possibly mean somebody else—at least that he might at

6815	least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.

6816	

6817	Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company

6818	would be a palpable improvement, he thought.

6819	

6820	

6821	

6822	

6823	CHAPTER XXVII

6824	

6825	

6826	THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom’s dreams that night.

6827	Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times

6828	it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and

6829	wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay

6830	in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he

6831	noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away—somewhat as if

6832	they had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it

6833	occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There

6834	was one very strong argument in favor of this idea—namely, that the

6835	quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen

6836	as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of

6837	his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to

6838	“hundreds” and “thousands” were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that

6839	no such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for

6840	a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in

6841	actual money in any one’s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure

6842	had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of

6843	real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.

6844	

6845	But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer

6846	under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found

6847	himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a

6848	dream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a

6849	hurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale

6850	of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking

6851	very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If

6852	he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a

6853	dream.

6854	

6855	“Hello, Huck!”

6856	

6857	“Hello, yourself.”

6858	

6859	Silence, for a minute.

6860	

6861	“Tom, if we’d ’a’ left the blame tools at the dead tree, we’d ’a’ got

6862	the money. Oh, ain’t it awful!”

6863	

6864	“’Tain’t a dream, then, ’tain’t a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.

6865	Dog’d if I don’t, Huck.”

6866	

6867	“What ain’t a dream?”

6868	

6869	“Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.”

6870	

6871	“Dream! If them stairs hadn’t broke down you’d ’a’ seen how much dream

6872	it was! I’ve had dreams enough all night—with that patch-eyed Spanish

6873	devil going for me all through ’em—rot him!”

6874	

6875	“No, not rot him. _Find_ him! Track the money!”

6876	

6877	“Tom, we’ll never find him. A feller don’t have only one chance for such

6878	a pile—and that one’s lost. I’d feel mighty shaky if I was to see him,

6879	anyway.”

6880	

6881	“Well, so’d I; but I’d like to see him, anyway—and track him out—to his

6882	Number Two.”

6883	

6884	“Number Two—yes, that’s it. I been thinking ’bout that. But I can’t make

6885	nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?”

6886	

6887	“I dono. It’s too deep. Say, Huck—maybe it’s the number of a house!”

6888	

6889	“Goody!... No, Tom, that ain’t it. If it is, it ain’t in this one-horse

6890	town. They ain’t no numbers here.”

6891	

6892	“Well, that’s so. Lemme think a minute. Here—it’s the number of a

6893	room—in a tavern, you know!”

6894	

6895	“Oh, that’s the trick! They ain’t only two taverns. We can find out

6896	quick.”

6897	

6898	“You stay here, Huck, till I come.”

6899	

6900	Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck’s company in public

6901	places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.

6902	2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.

6903	In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper’s

6904	young son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody

6905	go into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any

6906	particular reason for this state of things; had had some little

6907	curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery

6908	by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was “ha’nted”; had

6909	noticed that there was a light in there the night before.

6910	

6911	“That’s what I’ve found out, Huck. I reckon that’s the very No. 2 we’re

6912	after.”

6913	

6914	“I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?”

6915	

6916	“Lemme think.”

6917	

6918	Tom thought a long time. Then he said:

6919	

6920	“I’ll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out

6921	into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap

6922	of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and

6923	I’ll nip all of auntie’s, and the first dark night we’ll go there and

6924	try ’em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he

6925	was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get

6926	his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don’t go to

6927	that No. 2, that ain’t the place.”

6928	

6929	“Lordy, I don’t want to foller him by myself!”

6930	

6931	“Why, it’ll be night, sure. He mightn’t ever see you—and if he did,

6932	maybe he’d never think anything.”

6933	

6934	“Well, if it’s pretty dark I reckon I’ll track him. I dono—I dono. I’ll

6935	try.”

6936	

6937	“You bet I’ll follow him, if it’s dark, Huck. Why, he might ’a’ found

6938	out he couldn’t get his revenge, and be going right after that money.”

6939	

6940	“It’s so, Tom, it’s so. I’ll foller him; I will, by jingoes!”

6941	

6942	“Now you’re _talking_! Don’t you ever weaken, Huck, and I won’t.”

6943	

6944	

6945	

6946	

6947	CHAPTER XXVIII

6948	

6949	

6950	THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about

6951	the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley

6952	at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or

6953	left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern

6954	door. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the

6955	understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck

6956	was to come and “maow,” whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.

6957	But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to

6958	bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.

6959	

6960	Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday

6961	night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt’s

6962	old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the

6963	lantern in Huck’s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before

6964	midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)

6965	were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the

6966	alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned,

6967	the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of

6968	distant thunder.

6969	

6970	Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the

6971	towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.

6972	Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was

6973	a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck’s spirits like a

6974	mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern—it

6975	would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive

6976	yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have

6977	fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and

6978	excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer

6979	and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and

6980	momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away

6981	his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to

6982	inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the

6983	way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came

6984	tearing by him: “Run!” said he; “run, for your life!”

6985	

6986	He needn’t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or

6987	forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never

6988	stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the

6989	lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm

6990	burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:

6991	

6992	“Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;

6993	but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn’t hardly

6994	get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn’t turn in the lock, either.

6995	Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and

6996	open comes the door! It warn’t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the

6997	towel, and, _Great Caesar’s Ghost!_”

6998	

6999	“What!—what’d you see, Tom?”

7000	

7001	“Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe’s hand!”

7002	

7003	“No!”

7004	

7005	“Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch

7006	on his eye and his arms spread out.”

7007	

7008	“Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?”

7009	

7010	“No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and

7011	started!”

7012	

7013	“I’d never ’a’ thought of the towel, I bet!”

7014	

7015	“Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.”

7016	

7017	“Say, Tom, did you see that box?”

7018	

7019	“Huck, I didn’t wait to look around. I didn’t see the box, I didn’t see

7020	the cross. I didn’t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor

7021	by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.

7022	Don’t you see, now, what’s the matter with that ha’nted room?”

7023	

7024	“How?”

7025	

7026	“Why, it’s ha’nted with whiskey! Maybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have

7027	got a ha’nted room, hey, Huck?”

7028	

7029	“Well, I reckon maybe that’s so. Who’d ’a’ thought such a thing? But

7030	say, Tom, now’s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe’s

7031	drunk.”

7032	

7033	“It is, that! You try it!”

7034	

7035	Huck shuddered.

7036	

7037	“Well, no—I reckon not.”

7038	

7039	“And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain’t

7040	enough. If there’d been three, he’d be drunk enough and I’d do it.”

7041	

7042	There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:

7043	

7044	“Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun

7045	Joe’s not in there. It’s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we’ll

7046	be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we’ll

7047	snatch that box quicker’n lightning.”

7048	

7049	“Well, I’m agreed. I’ll watch the whole night long, and I’ll do it every

7050	night, too, if you’ll do the other part of the job.”

7051	

7052	“All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a

7053	block and maow—and if I’m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window

7054	and that’ll fetch me.”

7055	

7056	“Agreed, and good as wheat!”

7057	

7058	“Now, Huck, the storm’s over, and I’ll go home. It’ll begin to be

7059	daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will

7060	you?”

7061	

7062	“I said I would, Tom, and I will. I’ll ha’nt that tavern every night for

7063	a year! I’ll sleep all day and I’ll stand watch all night.”

7064	

7065	“That’s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?”

7066	

7067	“In Ben Rogers’ hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap’s nigger man,

7068	Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any

7069	time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.

7070	That’s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don’t ever act as

7071	if I was above him. Sometime I’ve set right down and eat _with_ him. But

7072	you needn’t tell that. A body’s got to do things when he’s awful hungry

7073	he wouldn’t want to do as a steady thing.”

7074	

7075	“Well, if I don’t want you in the daytime, I’ll let you sleep. I won’t

7076	come bothering around. Any time you see something’s up, in the night,

7077	just skip right around and maow.”

7078	

7079	

7080	

7081	

7082	CHAPTER XXIX

7083	

7084	

7085	THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of

7086	news—Judge Thatcher’s family had come back to town the night before.

7087	Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a

7088	moment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy’s interest. He saw her

7089	and they had an exhausting good time playing “hispy” and “gully-keeper”

7090	 with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in

7091	a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint

7092	the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she

7093	consented. The child’s delight was boundless; and Tom’s not more

7094	moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway

7095	the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation

7096	and pleasurable anticipation. Tom’s excitement enabled him to keep

7097	awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck’s

7098	“maow,” and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers

7099	with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.

7100	

7101	Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and

7102	rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher’s, and everything was

7103	ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the

7104	picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough

7105	under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young

7106	gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was

7107	chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main

7108	street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss

7109	the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.

7110	Thatcher said to Becky, was:

7111	

7112	“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better stay all night with

7113	some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.”

7114	

7115	“Then I’ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.”

7116	

7117	“Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”

7118	

7119	Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:

7120	

7121	“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll

7122	climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have

7123	ice-cream! She has it most every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be

7124	awful glad to have us.”

7125	

7126	“Oh, that will be fun!”

7127	

7128	Then Becky reflected a moment and said:

7129	

7130	“But what will mamma say?”

7131	

7132	“How’ll she ever know?”

7133	

7134	The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:

7135	

7136	“I reckon it’s wrong—but—”

7137	

7138	“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she

7139	wants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if

7140	she’d ’a’ thought of it. I know she would!”

7141	

7142	The Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and

7143	Tom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say

7144	nothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to

7145	Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The

7146	thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he

7147	could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he

7148	give it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before, so

7149	why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the

7150	evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined

7151	to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of

7152	the box of money another time that day.

7153	

7154	Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody

7155	hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest

7156	distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and

7157	laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone

7158	through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified

7159	with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things

7160	began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in

7161	the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:

7162	

7163	“Who’s ready for the cave?”

7164	

7165	Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there

7166	was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the

7167	hillside—an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood

7168	unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled

7169	by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was

7170	romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out

7171	upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the

7172	situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment

7173	a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a

7174	struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked

7175	down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a

7176	new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went

7177	filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of

7178	lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of

7179	junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than

7180	eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower

7181	crevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal’s cave was but a

7182	vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again

7183	and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights

7184	together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never

7185	find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and

7186	still down, into the earth, and it was just the same—labyrinth under

7187	labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man “knew” the cave. That was

7188	an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it

7189	was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer

7190	knew as much of the cave as any one.

7191	

7192	The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of

7193	a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch

7194	avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise

7195	at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude

7196	each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the

7197	“known” ground.

7198	

7199	By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth

7200	of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow

7201	drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of

7202	the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking

7203	no note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had

7204	been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day’s

7205	adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat

7206	with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for

7207	the wasted time but the captain of the craft.

7208	

7209	Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat’s lights went

7210	glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young

7211	people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly

7212	tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not

7213	stop at the wharf—and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his

7214	attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten

7215	o’clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began

7216	to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village

7217	betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the

7218	silence and the ghosts. Eleven o’clock came, and the tavern lights were

7219	put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long

7220	time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?

7221	Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?

7222	

7223	A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley

7224	door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next

7225	moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under

7226	his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.

7227	Why call Tom now? It would be absurd—the men would get away with the box

7228	and never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow

7229	them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So

7230	communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the

7231	men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough

7232	ahead not to be invisible.

7233	

7234	They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up

7235	a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the

7236	path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old

7237	Welshman’s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still

7238	climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.

7239	But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.

7240	They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and

7241	were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his

7242	distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along

7243	awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved

7244	on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that

7245	he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an

7246	owl came over the hill—ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was

7247	everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man

7248	cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck’s heart shot into his

7249	throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as

7250	if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he

7251	thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He

7252	knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas’

7253	grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won’t be hard

7254	to find.

7255	

7256	Now there was a voice—a very low voice—Injun Joe’s:

7257	

7258	“Damn her, maybe she’s got company—there’s lights, late as it is.”

7259	

7260	“I can’t see any.”

7261	

7262	This was that stranger’s voice—the stranger of the haunted house. A

7263	deadly chill went to Huck’s heart—this, then, was the “revenge” job! His

7264	thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been

7265	kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder

7266	her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn’t

7267	dare—they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in

7268	the moment that elapsed between the stranger’s remark and Injun Joe’s

7269	next—which was—

7270	

7271	“Because the bush is in your way. Now—this way—now you see, don’t you?”

7272	

7273	“Yes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.”

7274	

7275	“Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and

7276	maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I’ve told you

7277	before, I don’t care for her swag—you may have it. But her husband was

7278	rough on me—many times he was rough on me—and mainly he was the justice

7279	of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain’t all. It ain’t

7280	a millionth part of it! He had me _horsewhipped_!—horsewhipped in

7281	front of the jail, like a nigger!—with all the town looking on!

7282	_Horsewhipped_!—do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But

7283	I’ll take it out of _her_.”

7284	

7285	“Oh, don’t kill her! Don’t do that!”

7286	

7287	“Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was

7288	here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don’t

7289	kill her—bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils—you notch her

7290	ears like a sow!”

7291	

7292	“By God, that’s—”

7293	

7294	“Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I’ll tie her

7295	to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I’ll not cry, if

7296	she does. My friend, you’ll help me in this thing—for _my_ sake—that’s

7297	why you’re here—I mightn’t be able alone. If you flinch, I’ll kill you.

7298	Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I’ll kill her—and

7299	then I reckon nobody’ll ever know much about who done this business.”

7300	

7301	“Well, if it’s got to be done, let’s get at it. The quicker the

7302	better—I’m all in a shiver.”

7303	

7304	“Do it _now_? And company there? Look here—I’ll get suspicious of you,

7305	first thing you know. No—we’ll wait till the lights are out—there’s no

7306	hurry.”

7307	

7308	Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue—a thing still more awful

7309	than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped

7310	gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,

7311	one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one

7312	side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same

7313	elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and—a twig

7314	snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no

7315	sound—the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he

7316	turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes—turned

7317	himself as carefully as if he were a ship—and then stepped quickly but

7318	cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and

7319	so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he

7320	reached the Welshman’s. He banged at the door, and presently the heads

7321	of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.

7322	

7323	“What’s the row there? Who’s banging? What do you want?”

7324	

7325	“Let me in—quick! I’ll tell everything.”

7326	

7327	“Why, who are you?”

7328	

7329	“Huckleberry Finn—quick, let me in!”

7330	

7331	“Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain’t a name to open many doors, I judge!

7332	But let him in, lads, and let’s see what’s the trouble.”

7333	

7334	“Please don’t ever tell I told you,” were Huck’s first words when he got

7335	in. “Please don’t—I’d be killed, sure—but the widow’s been good friends

7336	to me sometimes, and I want to tell—I _will_ tell if you’ll promise you

7337	won’t ever say it was me.”

7338	

7339	“By George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn’t act so!”

7340	 exclaimed the old man; “out with it and nobody here’ll ever tell, lad.”

7341	

7342	Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the

7343	hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in

7344	their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great

7345	bowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and

7346	then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.

7347	

7348	Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as

7349	fast as his legs could carry him.

7350	

7351	

7352	

7353	

7354	CHAPTER XXX

7355	

7356	

7357	AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came

7358	groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman’s door. The

7359	inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,

7360	on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a

7361	window:

7362	

7363	“Who’s there!”

7364	

7365	Huck’s scared voice answered in a low tone:

7366	

7367	“Please let me in! It’s only Huck Finn!”

7368	

7369	“It’s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!—and welcome!”

7370	

7371	These were strange words to the vagabond boy’s ears, and the pleasantest

7372	he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever

7373	been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he

7374	entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall

7375	sons speedily dressed themselves.

7376	

7377	“Now, my boy, I hope you’re good and hungry, because breakfast will be

7378	ready as soon as the sun’s up, and we’ll have a piping hot one, too—make

7379	yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you’d turn up and stop

7380	here last night.”

7381	

7382	“I was awful scared,” said Huck, “and I run. I took out when the pistols

7383	went off, and I didn’t stop for three mile. I’ve come now becuz I wanted

7384	to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn’t

7385	want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.”

7386	

7387	“Well, poor chap, you do look as if you’d had a hard night of it—but

7388	there’s a bed here for you when you’ve had your breakfast. No, they

7389	ain’t dead, lad—we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right

7390	where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along

7391	on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them—dark as a cellar that

7392	sumach path was—and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the

7393	meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use—’twas bound to

7394	come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when

7395	the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,

7396	I sung out, ‘Fire boys!’ and blazed away at the place where the rustling

7397	was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and

7398	we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them.

7399	They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by

7400	and didn’t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet

7401	we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a

7402	posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it

7403	is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys

7404	will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of

7405	those rascals—’twould help a good deal. But you couldn’t see what they

7406	were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?”

7407	

7408	“Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.”

7409	

7410	“Splendid! Describe them—describe them, my boy!”

7411	

7412	“One’s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that’s ben around here once or

7413	twice, and t’other’s a mean-looking, ragged—”

7414	

7415	“That’s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back

7416	of the widow’s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and

7417	tell the sheriff—get your breakfast tomorrow morning!”

7418	

7419	The Welshman’s sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck

7420	sprang up and exclaimed:

7421	

7422	“Oh, please don’t tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them! Oh,

7423	please!”

7424	

7425	“All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what

7426	you did.”

7427	

7428	“Oh no, no! Please don’t tell!”

7429	

7430	When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:

7431	

7432	“They won’t tell—and I won’t. But why don’t you want it known?”

7433	

7434	Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too

7435	much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew

7436	anything against him for the whole world—he would be killed for knowing

7437	it, sure.

7438	

7439	The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:

7440	

7441	“How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking

7442	suspicious?”

7443	

7444	Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:

7445	

7446	“Well, you see, I’m a kind of a hard lot,—least everybody says so, and

7447	I don’t see nothing agin it—and sometimes I can’t sleep much, on account

7448	of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of

7449	doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn’t sleep, and so I

7450	come along upstreet ’bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I

7451	got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed

7452	up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes

7453	these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their

7454	arm, and I reckoned they’d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t’other one

7455	wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up

7456	their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,

7457	by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t’other one was a

7458	rusty, ragged-looking devil.”

7459	

7460	“Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?”

7461	

7462	This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:

7463	

7464	“Well, I don’t know—but somehow it seems as if I did.”

7465	

7466	“Then they went on, and you—”

7467	

7468	“Follered ’em—yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up—they sneaked

7469	along so. I dogged ’em to the widder’s stile, and stood in the dark and

7470	heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he’d

7471	spile her looks just as I told you and your two—”

7472	

7473	“What! The _deaf and dumb_ man said all that!”

7474	

7475	Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep

7476	the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,

7477	and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of

7478	all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape,

7479	but the old man’s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.

7480	Presently the Welshman said:

7481	

7482	“My boy, don’t be afraid of me. I wouldn’t hurt a hair of your head for

7483	all the world. No—I’d protect you—I’d protect you. This Spaniard is

7484	not deaf and dumb; you’ve let that slip without intending it; you can’t

7485	cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want

7486	to keep dark. Now trust me—tell me what it is, and trust me—I won’t

7487	betray you.”

7488	

7489	Huck looked into the old man’s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and

7490	whispered in his ear:

7491	

7492	“’Tain’t a Spaniard—it’s Injun Joe!”

7493	

7494	The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:

7495	

7496	“It’s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and

7497	slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because

7498	white men don’t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That’s a

7499	different matter altogether.”

7500	

7501	During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man

7502	said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going

7503	to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for

7504	marks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of—

7505	

7506	“Of _what_?”

7507	

7508	If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more

7509	stunning suddenness from Huck’s blanched lips. His eyes were staring

7510	wide, now, and his breath suspended—waiting for the answer. The Welshman

7511	started—stared in return—three seconds—five seconds—ten—then replied:

7512	

7513	“Of burglar’s tools. Why, what’s the _matter_ with you?”

7514	

7515	Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The

7516	Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously—and presently said:

7517	

7518	“Yes, burglar’s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what

7519	did give you that turn? What were _you_ expecting we’d found?”

7520	

7521	Huck was in a close place—the inquiring eye was upon him—he would have

7522	given anything for material for a plausible answer—nothing suggested

7523	itself—the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper—a senseless

7524	reply offered—there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered

7525	it—feebly:

7526	

7527	“Sunday-school books, maybe.”

7528	

7529	Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and

7530	joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and

7531	ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man’s pocket, because

7532	it cut down the doctor’s bill like everything. Then he added:

7533	

7534	“Poor old chap, you’re white and jaded—you ain’t well a bit—no wonder

7535	you’re a little flighty and off your balance. But you’ll come out of it.

7536	Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.”

7537	

7538	Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such

7539	a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel

7540	brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the

7541	talk at the widow’s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,

7542	however—he had not known that it wasn’t—and so the suggestion of a

7543	captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole

7544	he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all

7545	question that that bundle was not _the_ bundle, and so his mind was

7546	at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be

7547	drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still

7548	in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and

7549	Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of

7550	interruption.

7551	

7552	Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck

7553	jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even

7554	remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and

7555	gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of

7556	citizens were climbing up the hill—to stare at the stile. So the news

7557	had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the

7558	visitors. The widow’s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.

7559	

7560	“Don’t say a word about it, madam. There’s another that you’re more

7561	beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don’t allow me

7562	to tell his name. We wouldn’t have been there but for him.”

7563	

7564	Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the

7565	main matter—but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his

7566	visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he

7567	refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the

7568	widow said:

7569	

7570	“I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that

7571	noise. Why didn’t you come and wake me?”

7572	

7573	“We judged it warn’t worth while. Those fellows warn’t likely to come

7574	again—they hadn’t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of

7575	waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard

7576	at your house all the rest of the night. They’ve just come back.”

7577	

7578	More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple

7579	of hours more.

7580	

7581	There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody

7582	was early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came

7583	that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the

7584	sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher’s wife dropped alongside of Mrs.

7585	Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:

7586	

7587	“Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired

7588	to death.”

7589	

7590	“Your Becky?”

7591	

7592	“Yes,” with a startled look—“didn’t she stay with you last night?”

7593	

7594	“Why, no.”

7595	

7596	Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,

7597	talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:

7598	

7599	“Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I’ve got a boy

7600	that’s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last

7601	night—one of you. And now he’s afraid to come to church. I’ve got to

7602	settle with him.”

7603	

7604	Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.

7605	

7606	“He didn’t stay with us,” said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A

7607	marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly’s face.

7608	

7609	“Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?”

7610	

7611	“No’m.”

7612	

7613	“When did you see him last?”

7614	

7615	Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had

7616	stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding

7617	uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously

7618	questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed

7619	whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;

7620	it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One

7621	young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!

7622	Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her

7623	hands.

7624	

7625	The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to

7626	street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and

7627	the whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant

7628	insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs

7629	were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half

7630	an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward

7631	the cave.

7632	

7633	All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women

7634	visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They

7635	cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the

7636	tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at

7637	last, all the word that came was, “Send more candles—and send food.”

7638	 Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher

7639	sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed

7640	no real cheer.

7641	

7642	The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with

7643	candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck

7644	still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with

7645	fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came

7646	and took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,

7647	because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord’s,

7648	and nothing that was the Lord’s was a thing to be neglected. The

7649	Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:

7650	

7651	“You can depend on it. That’s the Lord’s mark. He don’t leave it off.

7652	He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his

7653	hands.”

7654	

7655	Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the

7656	village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the

7657	news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being

7658	ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and

7659	crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered

7660	through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither

7661	and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their

7662	hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place,

7663	far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names “BECKY &

7664	TOM” had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and

7665	near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the

7666	ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever

7667	have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so

7668	precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the

7669	awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away

7670	speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst

7671	forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle—and then a

7672	sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there;

7673	it was only a searcher’s light.

7674	

7675	Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and

7676	the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.

7677	The accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the

7678	Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the

7679	public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck

7680	feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked—dimly

7681	dreading the worst—if anything had been discovered at the Temperance

7682	Tavern since he had been ill.

7683	

7684	“Yes,” said the widow.

7685	

7686	Huck started up in bed, wildeyed:

7687	

7688	“What? What was it?”

7689	

7690	“Liquor!—and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child—what a turn you

7691	did give me!”

7692	

7693	“Only tell me just one thing—only just one—please! Was it Tom Sawyer

7694	that found it?”

7695	

7696	The widow burst into tears. “Hush, hush, child, hush! I’ve told you

7697	before, you must _not_ talk. You are very, very sick!”

7698	

7699	Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great

7700	powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever—gone

7701	forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should

7702	cry.

7703	

7704	These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck’s mind, and under the

7705	weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:

7706	

7707	“There—he’s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody

7708	could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain’t many left, now, that’s got hope

7709	enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.”

7710	

7711	

7712	

7713	

7714	CHAPTER XXXI

7715	

7716	

7717	NOW to return to Tom and Becky’s share in the picnic. They tripped along

7718	the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar

7719	wonders of the cave—wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names,

7720	such as “The Drawing-Room,” “The Cathedral,” “Aladdin’s Palace,” and

7721	so on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky

7722	engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle

7723	wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their

7724	candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates,

7725	postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been

7726	frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they

7727	scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls

7728	were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging

7729	shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream

7730	of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with

7731	it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara

7732	in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind

7733	it in order to illuminate it for Becky’s gratification. He found that

7734	it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between

7735	narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.

7736	

7737	Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future

7738	guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,

7739	far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and

7740	branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In

7741	one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a

7742	multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of

7743	a man’s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and

7744	presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into

7745	it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was

7746	incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst

7747	of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which

7748	had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites

7749	together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the

7750	roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a

7751	bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by

7752	hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their

7753	ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky’s hand and

7754	hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for

7755	a bat struck Becky’s light out with its wing while she was passing out

7756	of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the

7757	fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got

7758	rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,

7759	which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the

7760	shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would

7761	be best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the

7762	deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the

7763	children. Becky said:

7764	

7765	“Why, I didn’t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of

7766	the others.”

7767	

7768	“Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them—and I don’t know how

7769	far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn’t hear

7770	them here.”

7771	

7772	Becky grew apprehensive.

7773	

7774	“I wonder how long we’ve been down here, Tom? We better start back.”

7775	

7776	“Yes, I reckon we better. P’raps we better.”

7777	

7778	“Can you find the way, Tom? It’s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.”

7779	

7780	“I reckon I could find it—but then the bats. If they put our candles

7781	out it will be an awful fix. Let’s try some other way, so as not to go

7782	through there.”

7783	

7784	“Well. But I hope we won’t get lost. It would be so awful!” and the girl

7785	shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.

7786	

7787	They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long

7788	way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar

7789	about the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an

7790	examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he

7791	would say cheerily:

7792	

7793	“Oh, it’s all right. This ain’t the one, but we’ll come to it right

7794	away!”

7795	

7796	But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began

7797	to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of

7798	finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was “all right,” but

7799	there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their

7800	ring and sounded just as if he had said, “All is lost!” Becky clung to

7801	his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,

7802	but they would come. At last she said:

7803	

7804	“Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let’s go back that way! We seem to get

7805	worse and worse off all the time.”

7806	

7807	“Listen!” said he.

7808	

7809	Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were

7810	conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down

7811	the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that

7812	resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.

7813	

7814	“Oh, don’t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,” said Becky.

7815	

7816	“It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,” and

7817	he shouted again.

7818	

7819	The “might” was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so

7820	confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but

7821	there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried

7822	his steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his

7823	manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky—he could not find his way

7824	back!

7825	

7826	“Oh, Tom, you didn’t make any marks!”

7827	

7828	“Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to

7829	come back! No—I can’t find the way. It’s all mixed up.”

7830	

7831	“Tom, Tom, we’re lost! we’re lost! We never can get out of this awful

7832	place! Oh, why _did_ we ever leave the others!”

7833	

7834	She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom

7835	was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He

7836	sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in

7837	his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing

7838	regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom

7839	begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell

7840	to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable

7841	situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope

7842	again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he

7843	would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,

7844	she said.

7845	

7846	So they moved on again—aimlessly—simply at random—all they could do

7847	was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of

7848	reviving—not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its

7849	nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and

7850	familiarity with failure.

7851	

7852	By-and-by Tom took Becky’s candle and blew it out. This economy meant so

7853	much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again.

7854	She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his

7855	pockets—yet he must economize.

7856	

7857	By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay

7858	attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was

7859	grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction,

7860	was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to

7861	invite death and shorten its pursuit.

7862	

7863	At last Becky’s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.

7864	Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there,

7865	and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom

7866	tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements

7867	were grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore

7868	so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful.

7869	He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural

7870	under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and

7871	rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing

7872	into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and

7873	dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a

7874	breezy little laugh—but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan

7875	followed it.

7876	

7877	“Oh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I

7878	don’t, Tom! Don’t look so! I won’t say it again.”

7879	

7880	“I’m glad you’ve slept, Becky; you’ll feel rested, now, and we’ll find

7881	the way out.”

7882	

7883	“We can try, Tom; but I’ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I

7884	reckon we are going there.”

7885	

7886	“Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let’s go on trying.”

7887	

7888	They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried

7889	to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was

7890	that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not

7891	be, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this—they

7892	could not tell how long—Tom said they must go softly and listen for

7893	dripping water—they must find a spring. They found one presently, and

7894	Tom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky

7895	said she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to

7896	hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom

7897	fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought

7898	was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the

7899	silence:

7900	

7901	“Tom, I am so hungry!”

7902	

7903	Tom took something out of his pocket.

7904	

7905	“Do you remember this?” said he.

7906	

7907	Becky almost smiled.

7908	

7909	“It’s our wedding-cake, Tom.”

7910	

7911	“Yes—I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it’s all we’ve got.”

7912	

7913	“I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup

7914	people do with wedding-cake—but it’ll be our—”

7915	

7916	She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky

7917	ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was

7918	abundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky

7919	suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he

7920	said:

7921	

7922	“Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?”

7923	

7924	Becky’s face paled, but she thought she could.

7925	

7926	“Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there’s water to drink.

7927	That little piece is our last candle!”

7928	

7929	Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort

7930	her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:

7931	

7932	“Tom!”

7933	

7934	“Well, Becky?”

7935	

7936	“They’ll miss us and hunt for us!”

7937	

7938	“Yes, they will! Certainly they will!”

7939	

7940	“Maybe they’re hunting for us now, Tom.”

7941	

7942	“Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.”

7943	

7944	“When would they miss us, Tom?”

7945	

7946	“When they get back to the boat, I reckon.”

7947	

7948	“Tom, it might be dark then—would they notice we hadn’t come?”

7949	

7950	“I don’t know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they

7951	got home.”

7952	

7953	A frightened look in Becky’s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw

7954	that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!

7955	The children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of

7956	grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers

7957	also—that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher

7958	discovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper’s.

7959	

7960	The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it

7961	melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone

7962	at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of

7963	smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then—the horror of utter darkness

7964	reigned!

7965	

7966	How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that

7967	she was crying in Tom’s arms, neither could tell. All that they knew

7968	was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of

7969	a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said

7970	it might be Sunday, now—maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but

7971	her sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that

7972	they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going

7973	on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in

7974	the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no

7975	more.

7976	

7977	The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A

7978	portion of Tom’s half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But

7979	they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted

7980	desire.

7981	

7982	By-and-by Tom said:

7983	

7984	“SH! Did you hear that?”

7985	

7986	Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the

7987	faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by

7988	the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently

7989	he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little

7990	nearer.

7991	

7992	“It’s them!” said Tom; “they’re coming! Come along, Becky—we’re all

7993	right now!”

7994	

7995	The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,

7996	however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded

7997	against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three

7998	feet deep, it might be a hundred—there was no passing it at any rate.

7999	Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No

8000	bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They

8001	listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant!

8002	a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking

8003	misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He

8004	talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no

8005	sounds came again.

8006	

8007	The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged

8008	on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed

8009	it must be Tuesday by this time.

8010	

8011	Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It

8012	would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the

8013	heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to

8014	a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the

8015	line as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended

8016	in a “jumping-off place.” Tom got down on his knees and felt below,

8017	and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands

8018	conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the

8019	right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding

8020	a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,

8021	and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to—Injun

8022	Joe’s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the

8023	next moment, to see the “Spaniard” take to his heels and get himself out

8024	of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come

8025	over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have

8026	disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom’s

8027	fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he

8028	had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and

8029	nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He

8030	was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he

8031	had only shouted “for luck.”

8032	

8033	But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.

8034	Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought

8035	changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed

8036	that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,

8037	and that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another

8038	passage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But

8039	Becky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be

8040	roused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die—it would

8041	not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he

8042	chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak

8043	to her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would

8044	stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.

8045	

8046	Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show

8047	of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave;

8048	then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the

8049	passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with

8050	bodings of coming doom.

8051	

8052	

8053	

8054	

8055	CHAPTER XXXII

8056	

8057	

8058	TUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.

8059	Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public

8060	prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer

8061	that had the petitioner’s whole heart in it; but still no good news came

8062	from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest

8063	and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the

8064	children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great

8065	part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her

8066	call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,

8067	then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into

8068	a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The

8069	village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.

8070	

8071	Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village

8072	bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad

8073	people, who shouted, “Turn out! turn out! they’re found! they’re found!”

8074	 Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself

8075	and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage

8076	drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward

8077	march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after

8078	huzzah!

8079	

8080	The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the

8081	greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour

8082	a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher’s house, seized

8083	the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher’s hand, tried to

8084	speak but couldn’t—and drifted out raining tears all over the place.

8085	

8086	Aunt Polly’s happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher’s nearly so. It

8087	would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the

8088	great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon

8089	a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the

8090	wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it

8091	withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went

8092	on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his

8093	kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch

8094	of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off

8095	speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,

8096	pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad

8097	Mississippi rolling by!

8098	

8099	And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that

8100	speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He

8101	told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told

8102	him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was

8103	going to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and

8104	convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to

8105	where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way

8106	out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried

8107	for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them

8108	and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men

8109	didn’t believe the wild tale at first, “because,” said they, “you are

8110	five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in”—then took

8111	them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two

8112	or three hours after dark and then brought them home.

8113	

8114	Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him

8115	were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind

8116	them, and informed of the great news.

8117	

8118	Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to

8119	be shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were

8120	bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and

8121	more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday,

8122	was downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky

8123	did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had

8124	passed through a wasting illness.

8125	

8126	Tom learned of Huck’s sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could

8127	not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.

8128	He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his

8129	adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by

8130	to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event;

8131	also that the “ragged man’s” body had eventually been found in the river

8132	near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape,

8133	perhaps.

8134	

8135	About a fortnight after Tom’s rescue from the cave, he started off to

8136	visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting

8137	talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge

8138	Thatcher’s house was on Tom’s way, and he stopped to see Becky. The

8139	Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him

8140	ironically if he wouldn’t like to go to the cave again. Tom said he

8141	thought he wouldn’t mind it. The Judge said:

8142	

8143	“Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I’ve not the least doubt.

8144	But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any

8145	more.”

8146	

8147	“Why?”

8148	

8149	“Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and

8150	triple-locked—and I’ve got the keys.”

8151	

8152	Tom turned as white as a sheet.

8153	

8154	“What’s the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!”

8155	

8156	The water was brought and thrown into Tom’s face.

8157	

8158	“Ah, now you’re all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?”

8159	

8160	“Oh, Judge, Injun Joe’s in the cave!”

8161	

8162	

8163	

8164	

8165	CHAPTER XXXIII

8166	

8167	

8168	WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of

8169	men were on their way to McDougal’s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled

8170	with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore

8171	Judge Thatcher.

8172	

8173	When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in

8174	the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,

8175	dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing

8176	eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer

8177	of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own

8178	experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but

8179	nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,

8180	which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated

8181	before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day

8182	he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.

8183	

8184	Injun Joe’s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great

8185	foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with

8186	tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a

8187	sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought

8188	no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there

8189	had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless

8190	still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have

8191	squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked

8192	that place in order to be doing something—in order to pass the weary

8193	time—in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could

8194	find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this

8195	vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner

8196	had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a

8197	few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The

8198	poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a

8199	stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded

8200	by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off

8201	the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had

8202	scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once

8203	in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick—a

8204	dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling

8205	when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome

8206	were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the

8207	British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was

8208	“news.”

8209	

8210	It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall

8211	have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition,

8212	and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a

8213	purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand

8214	years to be ready for this flitting human insect’s need? and has it

8215	another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No

8216	matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped

8217	out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist

8218	stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when

8219	he comes to see the wonders of McDougal’s cave. Injun Joe’s cup stands

8220	first in the list of the cavern’s marvels; even “Aladdin’s Palace”

8221	 cannot rival it.

8222	

8223	Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked

8224	there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and

8225	hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and

8226	all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as

8227	satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the

8228	hanging.

8229	

8230	This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing—the petition to the

8231	governor for Injun Joe’s pardon. The petition had been largely signed;

8232	many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of

8233	sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the

8234	governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty

8235	under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the

8236	village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would

8237	have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a

8238	pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired

8239	and leaky water-works.

8240	

8241	The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have

8242	an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom’s adventure from the

8243	Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned

8244	there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted

8245	to talk about now. Huck’s face saddened. He said:

8246	

8247	“I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but

8248	whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must ’a’ ben

8249	you, soon as I heard ’bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you

8250	hadn’t got the money becuz you’d ’a’ got at me some way or other and

8251	told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something’s always

8252	told me we’d never get holt of that swag.”

8253	

8254	“Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern

8255	was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don’t you remember you

8256	was to watch there that night?”

8257	

8258	“Oh yes! Why, it seems ’bout a year ago. It was that very night that I

8259	follered Injun Joe to the widder’s.”

8260	

8261	“_You_ followed him?”

8262	

8263	“Yes—but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe’s left friends behind him, and

8264	I don’t want ’em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn’t

8265	ben for me he’d be down in Texas now, all right.”

8266	

8267	Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only

8268	heard of the Welshman’s part of it before.

8269	

8270	“Well,” said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, “whoever

8271	nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon—anyways

8272	it’s a goner for us, Tom.”

8273	

8274	“Huck, that money wasn’t ever in No. 2!”

8275	

8276	“What!” Huck searched his comrade’s face keenly. “Tom, have you got on

8277	the track of that money again?”

8278	

8279	“Huck, it’s in the cave!”

8280	

8281	Huck’s eyes blazed.

8282	

8283	“Say it again, Tom.”

8284	

8285	“The money’s in the cave!”

8286	

8287	“Tom—honest injun, now—is it fun, or earnest?”

8288	

8289	“Earnest, Huck—just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in

8290	there with me and help get it out?”

8291	

8292	“I bet I will! I will if it’s where we can blaze our way to it and not

8293	get lost.”

8294	

8295	“Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the

8296	world.”

8297	

8298	“Good as wheat! What makes you think the money’s—”

8299	

8300	“Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don’t find it I’ll

8301	agree to give you my drum and every thing I’ve got in the world. I will,

8302	by jings.”

8303	

8304	“All right—it’s a whiz. When do you say?”

8305	

8306	“Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?”

8307	

8308	“Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,

8309	now, but I can’t walk more’n a mile, Tom—least I don’t think I could.”

8310	

8311	“It’s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,

8312	but there’s a mighty short cut that they don’t anybody but me know

8313	about. Huck, I’ll take you right to it in a skiff. I’ll float the skiff

8314	down there, and I’ll pull it back again all by myself. You needn’t ever

8315	turn your hand over.”

8316	

8317	“Less start right off, Tom.”

8318	

8319	“All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little

8320	bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled

8321	things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many’s the time I wished I

8322	had some when I was in there before.”

8323	

8324	A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who

8325	was absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles

8326	below “Cave Hollow,” Tom said:

8327	

8328	“Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the

8329	cave hollow—no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see

8330	that white place up yonder where there’s been a landslide? Well, that’s

8331	one of my marks. We’ll get ashore, now.”

8332	

8333	They landed.

8334	

8335	“Now, Huck, where we’re a-standing you could touch that hole I got out

8336	of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.”

8337	

8338	Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly

8339	marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:

8340	

8341	“Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it’s the snuggest hole in this country.

8342	You just keep mum about it. All along I’ve been wanting to be a robber,

8343	but I knew I’d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across

8344	it was the bother. We’ve got it now, and we’ll keep it quiet, only we’ll

8345	let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in—because of course there’s got to be a

8346	Gang, or else there wouldn’t be any style about it. Tom Sawyer’s Gang—it

8347	sounds splendid, don’t it, Huck?”

8348	

8349	“Well, it just does, Tom. And who’ll we rob?”

8350	

8351	“Oh, most anybody. Waylay people—that’s mostly the way.”

8352	

8353	“And kill them?”

8354	

8355	“No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.”

8356	

8357	“What’s a ransom?”

8358	

8359	“Money. You make them raise all they can, off’n their friends; and after

8360	you’ve kept them a year, if it ain’t raised then you kill them. That’s

8361	the general way. Only you don’t kill the women. You shut up the women,

8362	but you don’t kill them. They’re always beautiful and rich, and awfully

8363	scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat

8364	off and talk polite. They ain’t anybody as polite as robbers—you’ll see

8365	that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they’ve

8366	been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that

8367	you couldn’t get them to leave. If you drove them out they’d turn right

8368	around and come back. It’s so in all the books.”

8369	

8370	“Why, it’s real bully, Tom. I believe it’s better’n to be a pirate.”

8371	

8372	“Yes, it’s better in some ways, because it’s close to home and circuses

8373	and all that.”

8374	

8375	By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in

8376	the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then

8377	made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought

8378	them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.

8379	He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay

8380	against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame

8381	struggle and expire.

8382	

8383	The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and

8384	gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently

8385	entered and followed Tom’s other corridor until they reached the

8386	“jumping-off place.” The candles revealed the fact that it was not

8387	really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet

8388	high. Tom whispered:

8389	

8390	“Now I’ll show you something, Huck.”

8391	

8392	He held his candle aloft and said:

8393	

8394	“Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There—on the

8395	big rock over yonder—done with candle-smoke.”

8396	

8397	“Tom, it’s a _cross_!”

8398	

8399	“_Now_ where’s your Number Two? ‘_under the cross_,’ hey? Right yonder’s

8400	where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!”

8401	

8402	Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:

8403	

8404	“Tom, less git out of here!”

8405	

8406	“What! and leave the treasure?”

8407	

8408	“Yes—leave it. Injun Joe’s ghost is round about there, certain.”

8409	

8410	“No it ain’t, Huck, no it ain’t. It would ha’nt the place where he

8411	died—away out at the mouth of the cave—five mile from here.”

8412	

8413	“No, Tom, it wouldn’t. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of

8414	ghosts, and so do you.”

8415	

8416	Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Mis-givings gathered in his mind.

8417	But presently an idea occurred to him—

8418	

8419	“Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we’re making of ourselves! Injun Joe’s

8420	ghost ain’t a going to come around where there’s a cross!”

8421	

8422	The point was well taken. It had its effect.

8423	

8424	“Tom, I didn’t think of that. But that’s so. It’s luck for us, that

8425	cross is. I reckon we’ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.”

8426	

8427	Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.

8428	Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the

8429	great rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.

8430	They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with

8431	a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some

8432	bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there

8433	was no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in

8434	vain. Tom said:

8435	

8436	“He said _under_ the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the

8437	cross. It can’t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the

8438	ground.”

8439	

8440	They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck

8441	could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:

8442	

8443	“Lookyhere, Huck, there’s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay

8444	about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what’s

8445	that for? I bet you the money _is_ under the rock. I’m going to dig in

8446	the clay.”

8447	

8448	“That ain’t no bad notion, Tom!” said Huck with animation.

8449	

8450	Tom’s “real Barlow” was out at once, and he had not dug four inches

8451	before he struck wood.

8452	

8453	“Hey, Huck!—you hear that?”

8454	

8455	Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and

8456	removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.

8457	Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he

8458	could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed

8459	to explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended

8460	gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to

8461	the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and

8462	exclaimed:

8463	

8464	“My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!”

8465	

8466	It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,

8467	along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two

8468	or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish

8469	well soaked with the water-drip.

8470	

8471	“Got it at last!” said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with

8472	his hand. “My, but we’re rich, Tom!”

8473	

8474	“Huck, I always reckoned we’d get it. It’s just too good to believe, but

8475	we _have_ got it, sure! Say—let’s not fool around here. Let’s snake it

8476	out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.”

8477	

8478	It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward

8479	fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.

8480	

8481	“I thought so,” he said; “_They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day

8482	at the ha’nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of

8483	fetching the little bags along.”

8484	

8485	The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross

8486	rock.

8487	

8488	“Now less fetch the guns and things,” said Huck.

8489	

8490	“No, Huck—leave them there. They’re just the tricks to have when we

8491	go to robbing. We’ll keep them there all the time, and we’ll hold our

8492	orgies there, too. It’s an awful snug place for orgies.”

8493	

8494	“What orgies?”

8495	

8496	“I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we’ve got to

8497	have them, too. Come along, Huck, we’ve been in here a long time. It’s

8498	getting late, I reckon. I’m hungry, too. We’ll eat and smoke when we get

8499	to the skiff.”

8500	

8501	They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily

8502	out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the

8503	skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got

8504	under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting

8505	cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.

8506	

8507	“Now, Huck,” said Tom, “we’ll hide the money in the loft of the widow’s

8508	woodshed, and I’ll come up in the morning and we’ll count it and divide,

8509	and then we’ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be

8510	safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook

8511	Benny Taylor’s little wagon; I won’t be gone a minute.”

8512	

8513	He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small

8514	sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,

8515	dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman’s

8516	house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the

8517	Welshman stepped out and said:

8518	

8519	“Hallo, who’s that?”

8520	

8521	“Huck and Tom Sawyer.”

8522	

8523	“Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.

8524	Here—hurry up, trot ahead—I’ll haul the wagon for you. Why, it’s not as

8525	light as it might be. Got bricks in it?—or old metal?”

8526	

8527	“Old metal,” said Tom.

8528	

8529	“I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away

8530	more time hunting up six bits’ worth of old iron to sell to the foundry

8531	than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that’s

8532	human nature—hurry along, hurry along!”

8533	

8534	The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.

8535	

8536	“Never mind; you’ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas’.”

8537	

8538	Huck said with some apprehension—for he was long used to being falsely

8539	accused:

8540	

8541	“Mr. Jones, we haven’t been doing nothing.”

8542	

8543	The Welshman laughed.

8544	

8545	“Well, I don’t know, Huck, my boy. I don’t know about that. Ain’t you

8546	and the widow good friends?”

8547	

8548	“Yes. Well, she’s ben good friends to me, anyway.”

8549	

8550	“All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?”

8551	

8552	This question was not entirely answered in Huck’s slow mind before he

8553	found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas’ drawing-room.

8554	Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.

8555	

8556	The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence

8557	in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the

8558	Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great

8559	many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys

8560	as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They

8561	were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson

8562	with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered

8563	half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:

8564	

8565	“Tom wasn’t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and

8566	Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.”

8567	

8568	“And you did just right,” said the widow. “Come with me, boys.”

8569	

8570	She took them to a bedchamber and said:

8571	

8572	“Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of

8573	clothes—shirts, socks, everything complete. They’re Huck’s—no, no

8574	thanks, Huck—Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they’ll fit both

8575	of you. Get into them. We’ll wait—come down when you are slicked up

8576	enough.”

8577	

8578	Then she left.

8579	

8580	

8581	

8582	

8583	CHAPTER XXXIV

8584	

8585	

8586	HUCK said: “Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain’t

8587	high from the ground.”

8588	

8589	“Shucks! what do you want to slope for?”

8590	

8591	“Well, I ain’t used to that kind of a crowd. I can’t stand it. I ain’t

8592	going down there, Tom.”

8593	

8594	“Oh, bother! It ain’t anything. I don’t mind it a bit. I’ll take care of

8595	you.”

8596	

8597	Sid appeared.

8598	

8599	“Tom,” said he, “auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary

8600	got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody’s been fretting about you.

8601	Say—ain’t this grease and clay, on your clothes?”

8602	

8603	“Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist ’tend to your own business. What’s all this

8604	blowout about, anyway?”

8605	

8606	“It’s one of the widow’s parties that she’s always having. This time

8607	it’s for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they

8608	helped her out of the other night. And say—I can tell you something, if

8609	you want to know.”

8610	

8611	“Well, what?”

8612	

8613	“Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people

8614	here tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a

8615	secret, but I reckon it’s not much of a secret now. Everybody knows—the

8616	widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don’t. Mr. Jones was bound

8617	Huck should be here—couldn’t get along with his grand secret without

8618	Huck, you know!”

8619	

8620	“Secret about what, Sid?”

8621	

8622	“About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow’s. I reckon Mr. Jones was

8623	going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop

8624	pretty flat.”

8625	

8626	Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.

8627	

8628	“Sid, was it you that told?”

8629	

8630	“Oh, never mind who it was. _Somebody_ told—that’s enough.”

8631	

8632	“Sid, there’s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and

8633	that’s you. If you had been in Huck’s place you’d ’a’ sneaked down the

8634	hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can’t do any but mean

8635	things, and you can’t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.

8636	There—no thanks, as the widow says”—and Tom cuffed Sid’s ears and helped

8637	him to the door with several kicks. “Now go and tell auntie if you

8638	dare—and tomorrow you’ll catch it!”

8639	

8640	Some minutes later the widow’s guests were at the supper-table, and a

8641	dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,

8642	after the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.

8643	Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the

8644	honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was

8645	another person whose modesty—

8646	

8647	And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck’s share in

8648	the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the

8649	surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and

8650	effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,

8651	the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many

8652	compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot

8653	the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely

8654	intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody’s gaze

8655	and everybody’s laudations.

8656	

8657	The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him

8658	educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in

8659	business in a modest way. Tom’s chance was come. He said:

8660	

8661	“Huck don’t need it. Huck’s rich.”

8662	

8663	Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept

8664	back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But

8665	the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:

8666	

8667	“Huck’s got money. Maybe you don’t believe it, but he’s got lots of it.

8668	Oh, you needn’t smile—I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.”

8669	

8670	Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed

8671	interest—and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.

8672	

8673	“Sid, what ails Tom?” said Aunt Polly. “He—well, there ain’t ever any

8674	making of that boy out. I never—”

8675	

8676	Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly

8677	did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the

8678	table and said:

8679	

8680	“There—what did I tell you? Half of it’s Huck’s and half of it’s mine!”

8681	

8682	The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for

8683	a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said

8684	he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of

8685	interest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the

8686	charm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:

8687	

8688	“I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it

8689	don’t amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I’m

8690	willing to allow.”

8691	

8692	The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand

8693	dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time

8694	before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably

8695	more than that in property.

8696	

8697	

8698	

8699	

8700	CHAPTER XXXV

8701	

8702	

8703	THE reader may rest satisfied that Tom’s and Huck’s windfall made a

8704	mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a

8705	sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked

8706	about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens

8707	tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every “haunted”

8708	 house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,

8709	plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden

8710	treasure—and not by boys, but men—pretty grave, unromantic men, too,

8711	some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired,

8712	stared at. The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had

8713	possessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and

8714	repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as

8715	remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying

8716	commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and

8717	discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper

8718	published biographical sketches of the boys.

8719	

8720	The Widow Douglas put Huck’s money out at six per cent., and Judge

8721	Thatcher did the same with Tom’s at Aunt Polly’s request. Each lad had

8722	an income, now, that was simply prodigious—a dollar for every weekday in

8723	the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got—no,

8724	it was what he was promised—he generally couldn’t collect it. A dollar

8725	and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old

8726	simple days—and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.

8727	

8728	Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no

8729	commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When

8730	Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her

8731	whipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded

8732	grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that

8733	whipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine

8734	outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie—a lie that

8735	was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to

8736	breast with George Washington’s lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky

8737	thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he

8738	walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight

8739	off and told Tom about it.

8740	

8741	Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some

8742	day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the

8743	National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school

8744	in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or

8745	both.

8746	

8747	Huck Finn’s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas’

8748	protection introduced him into society—no, dragged him into it, hurled

8749	him into it—and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The

8750	widow’s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they

8751	bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot

8752	or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had

8753	to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate;

8754	he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so

8755	properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he

8756	turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him

8757	hand and foot.

8758	

8759	He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up

8760	missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in

8761	great distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high

8762	and low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning

8763	Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind

8764	the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.

8765	Huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and

8766	ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was

8767	unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made

8768	him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him

8769	out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.

8770	Huck’s face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He

8771	said:

8772	

8773	“Don’t talk about it, Tom. I’ve tried it, and it don’t work; it don’t

8774	work, Tom. It ain’t for me; I ain’t used to it. The widder’s good to me,

8775	and friendly; but I can’t stand them ways. She makes me get up just

8776	at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all

8777	to thunder; she won’t let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them

8778	blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don’t seem to any air

8779	git through ’em, somehow; and they’re so rotten nice that I can’t

8780	set down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher’s; I hain’t slid on a

8781	cellar-door for—well, it ’pears to be years; I got to go to church

8782	and sweat and sweat—I hate them ornery sermons! I can’t ketch a fly in

8783	there, I can’t chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by

8784	a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell—everything’s so

8785	awful reg’lar a body can’t stand it.”

8786	

8787	“Well, everybody does that way, Huck.”

8788	

8789	“Tom, it don’t make no difference. I ain’t everybody, and I can’t

8790	_stand_ it. It’s awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy—I don’t

8791	take no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing;

8792	I got to ask to go in a-swimming—dern’d if I hain’t got to ask to do

8793	everything. Well, I’d got to talk so nice it wasn’t no comfort—I’d got

8794	to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste

8795	in my mouth, or I’d a died, Tom. The widder wouldn’t let me smoke;

8796	she wouldn’t let me yell, she wouldn’t let me gape, nor stretch, nor

8797	scratch, before folks—” [Then with a spasm of special irritation and

8798	injury]—“And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a

8799	woman! I _had_ to shove, Tom—I just had to. And besides, that school’s

8800	going to open, and I’d a had to go to it—well, I wouldn’t stand _that_,

8801	Tom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain’t what it’s cracked up to be. It’s

8802	just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead

8803	all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar’l suits me, and

8804	I ain’t ever going to shake ’em any more. Tom, I wouldn’t ever got into

8805	all this trouble if it hadn’t ’a’ ben for that money; now you just take

8806	my sheer of it along with your’n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes—not

8807	many times, becuz I don’t give a dern for a thing ’thout it’s tollable

8808	hard to git—and you go and beg off for me with the widder.”

8809	

8810	“Oh, Huck, you know I can’t do that. ’Tain’t fair; and besides if you’ll

8811	try this thing just a while longer you’ll come to like it.”

8812	

8813	“Like it! Yes—the way I’d like a hot stove if I was to set on it long

8814	enough. No, Tom, I won’t be rich, and I won’t live in them cussed

8815	smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and

8816	I’ll stick to ’em, too. Blame it all! just as we’d got guns, and a cave,

8817	and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up

8818	and spile it all!”

8819	

8820	Tom saw his opportunity—

8821	

8822	“Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain’t going to keep me back from turning

8823	robber.”

8824	

8825	“No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?”

8826	

8827	“Just as dead earnest as I’m sitting here. But Huck, we can’t let you

8828	into the gang if you ain’t respectable, you know.”

8829	

8830	Huck’s joy was quenched.

8831	

8832	“Can’t let me in, Tom? Didn’t you let me go for a pirate?”

8833	

8834	“Yes, but that’s different. A robber is more high-toned than what a

8835	pirate is—as a general thing. In most countries they’re awful high up in

8836	the nobility—dukes and such.”

8837	

8838	“Now, Tom, hain’t you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn’t shet me

8839	out, would you, Tom? You wouldn’t do that, now, _would_ you, Tom?”

8840	

8841	“Huck, I wouldn’t want to, and I _don’t_ want to—but what would people

8842	say? Why, they’d say, ‘Mph! Tom Sawyer’s Gang! pretty low characters in

8843	it!’ They’d mean you, Huck. You wouldn’t like that, and I wouldn’t.”

8844	

8845	Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he

8846	said:

8847	

8848	“Well, I’ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I

8849	can come to stand it, if you’ll let me b’long to the gang, Tom.”

8850	

8851	“All right, Huck, it’s a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I’ll ask the

8852	widow to let up on you a little, Huck.”

8853	

8854	“Will you, Tom—now will you? That’s good. If she’ll let up on some of

8855	the roughest things, I’ll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd

8856	through or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?”

8857	

8858	“Oh, right off. We’ll get the boys together and have the initiation

8859	tonight, maybe.”

8860	

8861	“Have the which?”

8862	

8863	“Have the initiation.”

8864	

8865	“What’s that?”

8866	

8867	“It’s to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang’s

8868	secrets, even if you’re chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and

8869	all his family that hurts one of the gang.”

8870	

8871	“That’s gay—that’s mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.”

8872	

8873	“Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing’s got to be done at midnight,

8874	in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find—a ha’nted house is the

8875	best, but they’re all ripped up now.”

8876	

8877	“Well, midnight’s good, anyway, Tom.”

8878	

8879	“Yes, so it is. And you’ve got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with

8880	blood.”

8881	

8882	“Now, that’s something _like_! Why, it’s a million times bullier than

8883	pirating. I’ll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be

8884	a reg’lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking ’bout it, I reckon

8885	she’ll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.”

8886	

8887	CONCLUSION

8888	

8889	SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a _boy_, it

8890	must stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the

8891	history of a _man_. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows

8892	exactly where to stop—that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of

8893	juveniles, he must stop where he best can.

8894	

8895	Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are

8896	prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the

8897	story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they

8898	turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that

8899	part of their lives at present.

8978	that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

8979	free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm

8980	works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

8982	comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

8989	check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this

8990	agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,

8991	distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any

9015	contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the

9016	copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in

9017	the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

9046	other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

9047	version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website

9048	(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense

9060	provided that:

9061	

9062	* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from

9063	  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method

9064	  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

9065	  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has

9066	  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project

9067	  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

9068	  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

9070	  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

9071	  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

9072	  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

9073	  Literary Archive Foundation."

9074

9076	  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

9077	  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm

9097	

9098	1.F.

9099	

9100	1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

9101	effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

9102	works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

9103	Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm

9104	electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may

9105	contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

9106	or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

9107	intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

9108	other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

9110	

9111	1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right

9112	of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

9113	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

9114	Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

9115	Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

9116	liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

9117	fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

9118	LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

9119	PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

9120	TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

9121	LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

9122	INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

9123	DAMAGE.

9124	

9125	1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

9126	defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

9127	receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

9128	written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

9129	received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

9130	with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you

9131	with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

9132	lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

9133	or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second

9134	opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

9135	the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing

9139	in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

9140	OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

9141	LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

9142	

9143	1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied

9144	warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

9145	damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement

9146	violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

9147	agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or

9148	limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

9149	unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

9150	remaining provisions.

9151	

9152	1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

9153	trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

9154	providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

9155	accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

9156	production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

9157	electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

9158	including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of

9159	the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

9160	or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or

9161	additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any

9162	Defect you cause.

9163	

9164	Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

9165	

9166	Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of

9167	electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

9168	computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It

9169	exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

9170	from people in all walks of life.

9171	

9172	Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

9173	assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

9174	goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

9175	remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

9176	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

9177	and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

9178	generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

9179	Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

9180	Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

9181	www.gutenberg.org

9182	

9183	Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

9184	Archive Foundation

9185	

9186	The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit

9187	501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

9188	state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

9189	Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

9190	number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

9198	

9199	Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

9200	Literary Archive Foundation

9201	

9202	Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without

9203	widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of

9204	increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

9205	freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest

9206	array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations

9207	($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

9208	status with the IRS.

9209	

9210	The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating

9211	charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

9212	States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a

9213	considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

9214	with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

9215	where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND

9216	DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

9217	state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

9218	

9219	While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

9220	have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

9221	against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

9222	approach us with offers to donate.

9224	International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

9225	any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

9226	outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

9227	

9228	Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation

9229	methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

9230	ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

9233	Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

9234	

9235	Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project

9236	Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be

9237	freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and

9238	distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of

9239	volunteer support.

9240	

9241	Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed

9242	editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in

9243	the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not

9244	necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper

9245	edition.

9246	

9247	Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

9248	facility: www.gutenberg.org

9249	

9250	This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,

9251	including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary

9252	Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to

9253	subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
