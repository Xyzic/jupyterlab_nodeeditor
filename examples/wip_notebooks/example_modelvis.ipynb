For example, under Inputs in Tab 3 it says \"Slot 1: input_rotxx (temp_in0)\" in the next row, but this is still all in the 2nd ipywidgets Label, just spread out for visual clarity in case of multiple Inputs/Outputs. If you need more to display, continue the index trend and do not worry about the rows. Be sure to add them to the initial length check as well so all rows are created properly.*"
